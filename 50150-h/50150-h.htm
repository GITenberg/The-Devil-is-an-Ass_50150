<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>In <i>The Devil is an Ass</i> Jonson may be studied, first, as a
student; secondly, as an observer. Separated by only two years
from the preceding play, <i>Bartholomew Fair</i>, and by nine from the
following, <i>The Staple of News</i>, the present play marks the close
of an epoch in the poet’s life, the period of his vigorous maturity.
Its relations with the plays of his earlier periods are therefore of
especial interest.</p>

<p>The results of the present editor’s study of these and other
literary connections are presented, partly in the Notes, and partly
in the Introduction to this book. After the discussion of the
purely technical problems in Sections A and B, the larger features
are taken up in Section C, I and II. These involve a study of the
author’s indebtedness to English, Italian, and classical sources, and
especially to the early English drama; as well as of his own dramatic
methods in previous plays. The more minute relations to contemporary
dramatists and to his own former work, especially in regard to
current words and phrases, are dealt with in the Notes.</p>

<p>As an observer, Jonson appears as a student of London, and a
satirist of its manners and vices; and, in a broader way, as a critic
of contemporary England. The life and aspect of London are treated,
for the most part, in the Notes; the issues of state involved in
Jonson’s satire are presented in historical discussions in Section C,
III. Personal satire is treated in the division following.</p>

<p>I desire to express my sincere thanks to Professor Albert S. Cook
for advice in matters of form and for inspiration in the work; to
Professor Henry A. Beers for painstaking discussion of difficult
questions; to Dr. De Winter for help and criticism; to Dr. John M.
Berdan for the privilege of consulting his copy of the Folio; to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Mr. Andrew Keogh and to Mr. Henry A. Gruener, for aid in
bibliographical matters; and to Professor George L. Burr for the loan
of books from the Cornell Library.</p>

<p>A portion of the expense of printing this book has been borne by
the Modern Language Club of Yale University from funds placed at its
disposal by the generosity of Mr. George E. Dimock of Elizabeth, New
Jersey, a graduate of Yale in the Class of 1874.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>A. EDITIONS OF THE TEXT</h3>

<p><i>The Devil is an Ass</i> was first printed in 1631, and was probably
put into circulation at that time, either as a separate pamphlet or bound
with <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> and <i>The Staple of News</i>. Copies of this
original edition were, in 1640-1, bound into the second volume of the
First Folio of Jonson’s collected works.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
In 1641 a variant reprint edition of <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>,
apparently small, was issued in pamphlet form. The play reappears in
all subsequent collected editions. These are: (1) the ‘Third Folio’,
1692; (2) a bookseller’s edition, 1716 [1717]; (3) Whalley’s edition,
1756; (4) John Stockdale’s reprint of Whalley’s edition (together
with the works of Beaumont and Fletcher), 1811; (5) Gifford’s
edition, 1816; (6) Barry Cornwall’s one-volume edition, 1838; (7)
Lieut. Col. Francis Cunningham’s three-volume reissue (with some
minor variations) of Gifford’s edition, 1871; (8) another reissue
by Cunningham, in nine volumes (with additional notes), 1875. The
<i>Catalogue</i> of the British Museum shows that Jonson’s works were
printed in two volumes at Dublin in 1729. Of these editions only the
first two call for detailed description, and of the others only the
first, second, third, fifth, and eighth will be discussed.</p>

<p><b>1631.</b> Owing to irregularity in contents and arrangement in
different copies, the second volume of the First Folio has been
much discussed. Gifford speaks of it as the edition of 1631-41.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Miss Bates, copying from Lowndes, gives it as belonging to 1631,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
reprinted in 1640 and in 1641.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Ward says substantially the same thing.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
In 1870, however, Brinsley Nicholson, by a careful collation,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
arrived at the following results. (1) The so-called editions of the
second volume assigned to 1631, 1640, and 1641 form only a single
edition. (2) The belief in the existence of ‘the so-called first
edition of the second volume in 1631’ is due to the dates prefixed
to the opening plays. (3) The belief in the existence of the volume
of 1641 arose from the dates of <i>Mortimer</i> and the <i>Discoveries</i>,
‘all the copies of which are dated 1641’, and of the variant edition
of <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>, which will next be described. (4) The 1640
edition supplies for some copies a general title-page, ‘R. Meighen,
1640’, but the plays printed in 1631 are reprinted from the same
forms. Hazlitt arrives at practically the same conclusions.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>One leaf (pages 89-90) is thus unaccounted for; but it is evident
from the signatures and pagination that <i>The Diuell is an Asse</i> was
printed with a view to having it follow <i>Bartholomew Fayre</i>. These
three plays were all printed by I. B. for Robert Allot in 1631.

<p>It was the opinion of both Whalley and Gifford that the publication
of <i>The Devil is an Ass</i> in 1631 was made without the personal
supervision of the author. Gifford did not believe that Jonson
‘concerned himself with the revision of the folio, ... or, indeed,
ever saw it’. The letter to the Earl of Newcastle (<i>Harl. MS.</i> 4955),
quoted in Gifford’s memoir, sufficiently disproves this supposition,
at least so far as <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> and <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>
are concerned. In this letter, written according to Gifford about 1632,
Jonson says: ‘It is the lewd printer’s fault that I can send your
lordship no more of my book. I sent you one piece before, The Fair,
... and now I send you this other morsel, The fine gentleman that
walks the town, The Fiend; but before he will perfect the rest I fear
he will come himself to be a part under the title of The Absolute
Knave, which he hath played with me’. In 1870 Brinsley Nicholson
quoted this letter in <i>Notes and Queries</i> (4th S. 5. 574), and
pointed out that the jocular allusions are evidently to <i>Bartholomew
Fair</i> and <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>.</p>

<p>Although Gifford is to some extent justified in his contempt for the
edition, it is on the whole fairly correct.</p>

<p>The misprints are not numerous. The play is overpunctuated.
Thus the words ‘now’ and ‘again’ are usually marked off by
commas. Occasionally the punctuation is misleading. The mark of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
interrogation is generally, but not invariably, used for that of
exclamation. The apostrophe is often a metrical device, and indicates
the blending of two words without actual elision of either. The most
serious defect is perhaps the wrong assignment of speeches, though
later emendations are to be accepted only with caution. The present
text aims to be an exact reproduction of that of the 1631 edition.</p>

<p>1641. The pamphlet quarto of 1641 is merely a poor reprint of the
1631 edition. It abounds in printer’s errors. Few if any intentional
changes, even of spelling and punctuation, are introduced. Little
intelligence is shown by the printer, as in the change 5. I. 34 SN.
(references are to act, scene, and line) He flags] He stags. It is
however of some slight importance, inasmuch as it seems to have been
followed in some instances by succeeding editions (cf. the omission
of the side notes 2. I. 20, 22, 33, followed by 1692, 1716, and W;
also 2. I. 46 his] a 1641, f.).</p>

<p>The title-page of this edition is copied, as far as the quotation
from Horace, from the title-page of the 1631 edition. For the
wood-cut of that edition, however, is substituted the device of a
swan, with the legend ‘God is my helper’. Then follow the words:
‘Imprinted at London, 1641.’</p>

<p>Folio by measurement; signatures in fours.</p>

<p>Collation: one leaf, containing the title-page on the recto, verso
blank; second leaf with signature A_2 (?), containing a device
(St. Francis preaching to the birds [?]), and the persons of the play on
the recto, and a device (a saint pointing to heaven and hell) and the
prologue on the verso. Then the play proper; B-I in fours; K
(one leaf). The first two leaves are unnumbered; then 1-66
(35 wrongly numbered 39).</p>

<p>1692. The edition of 1692<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
is a reprint of 1631, but furnishes evidence of some editing. Most of
the nouns are capitalized, and a change of speaker is indicated by
breaking the lines; obvious misprints are corrected: e. g., 1. 1. 98, 101;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
the spelling is modernized: e. g., 1. 1. 140 Tiborne] Tyburn; and the
punctuation is improved. Sometimes a word undergoes a considerable
morphological change: e. g., 1. 1. 67 Belins-gate] Billings-gate;
1. 6. 172, 175 venter] venture. Etymology is sometimes indicated by
an apostrophe, not always correctly: e. g., 2. 6. 75 salts] ’salts.
Several changes are uniform throughout the edition, and have been
followed by all later editors. The chief of these are: inough]
enough; tother] t’other; coozen] cozen; ha’s] has; then] than; ’hem]
’em (except G sometimes); injoy] enjoy. Several changes of wording
occur: e.g., 2. 1. 53 an] my; etc.</p>

<p>1716. The edition of 1716 is a bookseller’s reprint of 1692. It
follows that edition in the capitalization of nouns, the breaking up
of the lines, and usually in the punctuation. In 2. 1. 78-80 over two
lines are omitted by both editions. Independent editing, however, is
not altogether lacking. We find occasional new elisions: e. g., 1.
6. 121 I’have] I’ve; at least one change of wording: 2. 3. 25 where]
were; and one in the order of words: 4. 2. 22 not love] love not. In
4. 4. 75-76 and 76-78 it corrects two wrong assignments of speeches.
A regular change followed by all editors is wiues] wife’s.</p>

<p>1756. The edition of Peter Whalley, 1756, purports to be ‘collated
with all the former editions, and corrected’, but according to
modern standards it cannot be called a critical text. Not only
does it follow 1716 in modernization of spelling; alteration of
contractions: e. g., 2. 8. 69 To’a] T’a; 3. 1. 20 In t’one] Int’ one;
and changes in wording: e. g., 1. 1. 24 strengths] strength: 3. 6.
26 Gentleman] Gentlewoman; but it is evident that Whalley considered
the 1716 edition as the correct standard for a critical text, and
made his correction by a process of occasional restoration of the
original reading. Thus in restoring ‘Crane’, 1. 4. 50, he uses the
expression,&mdash;‘which is authorized by the folio of 1640.’ Again in 2.
1. 124 he retains ‘petty’ from 1716, although he says: ‘The edit.
of 1640, as I think more justly,&mdash;<i>Some</i> pretty <i>principality</i>.’
This reverence for the 1716 text is inexplicable. In the matter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
capitalization Whalley forsakes his model, and he makes emendations
of his own with considerable freedom. He still further modernizes the
spelling; he spells out elided words: e. g., 1. 3. 15 H’ has] he has;
makes new elisions: e. g., 1. 6. 143 Yo’ are] You’re; 1. 6. 211 I am]
I’m; grammatical changes, sometimes of doubtful correctness: e. g.,
1. 3. 21 I’le] I’d; morphological changes: e. g., 1. 6. 121 To scape]
T’escape; metrical changes by insertions: e. g., 1. 1. 48 ‘to’; 4. 7.
38 ‘but now’; changes of wording: e. g., 1. 6. 195 sad] said; in the
order of words: e. g., 3. 4. 59 is hee] he is; and in the assignment
of speeches: e. g., 3. 6. 61. Several printer’s errors occur:
e. g., 2. 6. 21 and 24.</p>

<p>1816. William Gifford’s edition is more carefully printed than
that of Whalley, whom he criticizes freely. In many indefensible
changes, however, he follows his predecessor, even to the insertion
of words in 1. 1. 48 and 4. 7. 38, 39 (see above). He makes further
morphological changes, even when involving a change of metre: e.g.,
1. 1. 11 Totnam] Tottenham; 1. 4. 88 phantsie] phantasie; makes new
elisions: e. g., 1. 6. 226 I ha’] I’ve; changes in wording: e. g.,
2. 1. 97 O’] O!; and in assignment of speeches: e. g., 4. 4. 17. He
usually omits parentheses, and the following changes in contracted
words occur, only exceptions being noted in the variants: fro’]
from; gi’] give; h’] he; ha’] have; ’hem] them (but often ’em); i’]
in; o’] on, of; t’] to; th’] the; upo’] upon; wi’] with, will; yo’]
you. Gifford’s greatest changes are in the stage directions and
side notes of the 1631 edition. The latter he considered as of ‘the
most trite and trifling nature’, and ‘a worthless incumbrance’. He
accordingly cut or omitted with the utmost freedom, introducing new
and elaborate stage directions of his own. He reduced the number of
scenes from thirty-six to seventeen. In this, as Hathaway points out,
he followed the regular English usage, dividing the scenes according
to actual changes of place. Jonson adhered to classical tradition,
and looked upon a scene as a situation. Gifford made his alterations
by combining whole scenes, except in the case of Act 2. 3, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
begins at Folio Act 2. 7. 23 (middle of line); of Act 3. 2, which
begins at Folio Act 3. 5. 65 and of Act 3. 3, which begins at Folio
Act 3. 5. 78 (middle of line). He considered himself justified in
his mutilation of the side notes on the ground that they were not
from the hand of Jonson. Evidence has already been adduced to show
that they were at any rate printed with his sanction. I am, however,
inclined to believe with Gifford that they were written by another
hand. Gifford’s criticism of them is to a large extent just. The note
on ‘<i>Niaise</i>’, 1. 6. 18, is of especially doubtful value
(<a href="#Note_1_6_18">see note</a>).</p>

<p>1875. ‘Cunningham’s reissue, 1875, reprints Gifford’s text without
change. Cunningham, however, frequently expresses his disapproval of
Gifford’s licence in changing the text’ (Winter).</p>

<h3><a name="Sect_B"></a>B. DATE AND PRESENTATION</h3>

<p>We learn from the title-page that this comedy was acted
in 1616 by the King’s Majesty’s Servants. This is further
confirmed by a passage in 1. 1. 80-81:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Now? As Vice stands this present yeere? Remember,</span>
<span class="i1">What number it is. <i>Six hundred</i> and <i>sixteene</i>.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Another passage (1. 6. 31) tells us that the performance
took place in the Blackfriars Theatre:</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Today, I goe to the <i>Black-fryers Play-house</i>.</p>

<p>That Fitzdottrel is to see <i>The Devil is an Ass</i> we learn later
(3. 5. 38). The performance was to take place after dinner (3. 5. 34).</p>

<p>At this time the King’s Men were in possession of two theatres,
the Globe and the Blackfriars. The former was used in the summer,
so that <i>The Devil is an Ass</i> was evidently not performed during
that season.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
These are all the facts that we can determine with certainty.</p>

<p>Jonson’s masque, <i>The Golden Age Restored</i>, was presented, according
to Fleay, on January 1 and 6. His next masque was <i>Christmas, his Masque</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
December 25, 1616. Between these dates he must have been
busy on <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>. Fleay, who identifies Fitzdottrel
with Coke, conjectures that the date of the play is probably late in
1616, after Coke’s discharge in November. If Coke is satirized either
in the person of Fitzdottrel or in that of Justice Eitherside (see
Introduction, pp. lxx, lxxii), the conjecture may be allowed to have
some weight.</p>

<p>In 1. 2. 1 Fitzdottrel speaks of Bretnor as occupying the position
once held by the conspirators in the Overbury case. Franklin, who
is mentioned, was not brought to trial until November 18, 1615.
Jonson does not speak of the trial as of a contemporary or nearly
contemporary event.</p>

<p>Act 4 is largely devoted to a satire of Spanish fashions. In 4. 2. 71
there is a possible allusion to the Infanta Maria, for whose marriage
with Prince Charles secret negotiations were being carried on at this
time. We learn that Commissioners were sent to Spain on November
9 (<i>Cal. State Papers, Dom. Ser.</i>), and from a letter of January
1, 1617, that ‘the Spanish tongue, dress, etc. are all in fashion’
(<i>ibid.</i>).</p>

<p>These indications are all of slight importance, but from their united
evidence we may feel reasonably secure in assigning the date of
presentation to late November or early December, 1616.</p>

<p>The play was not printed until 1631. It seems never to have been
popular, but was revived after the Restoration, and is given by
Downes<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
in the list of old plays acted in the New Theatre in Drury
Lane after April 8, 1663. He continues: ‘These being Old Plays,
were Acted but now and then; yet being well Perform’d were very
Satisfactory to the Town’. The other plays of Jonson revived by this
company were <i>The Fox</i>, <i>The Alchemist</i>, <i>Epicoene</i>, <i>Catiline</i>,
<i>Every Man out of his Humor</i>, <i>Every Man in his Humor</i>, and
<i>Sejanus</i>. Genest gives us no information of any later revival.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="Sect_C"></a>C. THE DEVIL IS AN ASS</h3>

<p>Jonson’s characteristic conception of comedy as a vehicle for the
study of ‘humors’ passed in <i>Every Man out of his Humor</i> into
caricature, and in <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i> and <i>Poetaster</i> into allegory.
The process was perfectly natural. In the humor study each character
is represented as absorbed by a single vice or folly. In the
allegorical treatment the abstraction is the starting-point, and the
human element the means of interpretation. Either type of drama, by
a shifting of emphasis, may readily pass over into the other. The
failure of <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i>, in spite of the poet’s arrogant boast
at its close, had an important effect upon his development, and the
plays of Jonson’s middle period, from <i>Sejanus</i> to <i>The Devil is an
Ass</i>, show more restraint in the handling of character, as well as
far greater care in construction. The figures are typical rather than
allegorical, and the plot in general centres about certain definite
objects of satire. Both plot and characterization are more closely unified.</p>

<p><i>The Devil is an Ass</i> marks a return to the supernatural and
allegorical. The main action, however, belongs strictly to the type
of the later drama, especially as exemplified by <i>The Alchemist</i>.
The fanciful motive of the infernal visitant to earth was found to
be of too slight texture for Jonson’s sternly moral and satirical
purpose. In the development of the drama it breaks down completely,
and is crowded out by the realistic plot. Thus what promised at first
to be the chief, and remains in some respects the happiest, motive
of the play comes in the final execution to be little better than
an inartistic and inharmonious excrescence. Yet Jonson’s words to
Drummond seem to indicate that he still looked upon it as the real
kernel of the play.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span></p>

<p>The action is thus easily divisible into two main lines; the
devil-plot, involving the fortunes of Satan, Pug and Iniquity, and
the satirical or main plot. This division is the more satisfactory,
since Satan and Iniquity are not once brought into contact with the
chief actors, while Pug’s connection with them is wholly external,
and affects only his own fortunes. He is, as Herford has already
pointed out, merely ‘the fly upon the engine-wheel, fortunate to
escape with a bruising’ (<i>Studies</i>, p. 320). He forms, however, the
connecting link between the two plots, and his function in the drama
must be regarded from two different points of view, according as it
shares in the realistic or the supernatural element.</p>

<h4><a name="Sect_C_I"></a>I. <span class="smcap">The Devil-Plot</span></h4>

<p>Jonson’s title, <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>, expresses with perfect
adequacy the familiarity and contempt with which this once
terrible personage had come to be regarded in the later
Elizabethan period. The poet, of course, is deliberately
archaizing, and the figures of devil and Vice are made
largely conformable to the purposes of satire. Several
years before, in the Dedication to <i>The Fox</i>,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Jonson had expressed his contempt for the introduction of ‘fools and
devils and those antique relics of barbarism’, characterizing
them as ‘ridiculous and exploded follies’. He treats the
same subject with biting satire in <i>The Staple of News</i>.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Yet with all his devotion to realism in matters of petty
detail, of local color, and of contemporary allusion, he was,
as we have seen, not without an inclination toward allegory.
Thus in <i>Every Man out of his Humor</i> the figure of Macilente
is very close to a purely allegorical expression of envy.
In <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i> the process was perfectly conscious, for
in the Induction to that play the characters are spoken of
as Virtues and Vices. In <i>Poetaster</i> again we have the
purging of Demetrius and Crispinus. Jonson’s return to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
this field in <i>The Devil is an Ass</i> is largely prophetic of
the future course of his drama. The allegory of <i>The Staple
of News</i> is more closely woven into the texture of the play
than is that of <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>; and the conception
of Pecunia and her retinue is worked out with much elaboration.
In the Second Intermean the purpose of this play
is explained as a refinement of method in the use of allegory.
For the old Vice with his wooden dagger to snap
at everybody he met, or Iniquity, appareled ‘like Hokos
Pokos, in a juggler’s jerkin’, he substitutes ‘vices male
and female’, ‘attired like men and women of the time’.
This of course is only a more philosophical and abstract
statement of the idea which he expresses in <i>The Devil is an
Ass</i> (1. 1. 120 f.) of a world where the vices are not distinguishable
by any outward sign from the virtues:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They weare the same clothes, eate the same meate,</span>
<span class="i0">Sleep i’ the self-same beds, ride i’ those coaches.</span>
<span class="i0">Or very like, foure horses in a coach,</span>
<span class="i0">As the best men and women.</span>
</div></div>

<p><i>The New Inn</i> and <i>The Magnetic Lady</i> are also penetrated
with allegory of a sporadic and trivial nature. Jonson’s use of devil
and Vice in the present play is threefold. It is in part earnestly
allegorical, especially in Satan’s long speech in the first scene;
it is in part a satire upon the employment of what he regarded as
barbarous devices; and it is, to no small extent, itself a resort for
the sake of comic effect to the very devices which he ridiculed.</p>

<p>Jonson’s conception of the devil was naturally very far from
mediæval, and he relied for the effectiveness of his portrait upon
current disbelief in this conception. Yet mediævalism had not wholly
died out, and remnants of the morality-play are to be found in many
plays of the Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. Rev. John Upton, in his
<i>Critical Observations on Shakespeare</i>, 1746, was the first to point
out the historical connection between Jonson’s Vice and devils and
those of the pre-Shakespearian drama. In modern times the history
of the devil and the Vice as dramatic figures has been thoroughly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
investigated, the latest works being those of Dr. L.W. Cushman and
Dr. E. Eckhardt, at whose hands the subject has received exhaustive
treatment. The connection with Machiavelli’s novella
of <i>Belfagor</i> was pointed out by Count Baudissin,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
<i>Ben Jonson und seine Schule</i>, Leipzig 1836, and has been worked
out exhaustively by Dr. E. Hollstein in a Halle dissertation,
1901. Dr. C.H. Herford, however, had already suggested
that the chief source of the devil-plot was to be found in
the legend of Friar Rush.</p>

<h5><a name="Sect_C_I_1"></a>1. <i>The Devil in the pre-Shakespearian Drama</i></h5>

<p>The sources for the conception of the devil in the mediæval drama
are to be sought in a large body of non-dramatic literature. In this
literature the devil was conceived of as a fallen angel, the enemy of
God and his hierarchy, and the champion of evil. As such he makes his
appearance in the mystery-plays. The mysteries derived their subjects
from Bible history, showed comparatively little pliancy, and dealt
always with serious themes. In them the devil is with few exceptions
a serious figure. Occasionally, however, even at this early date,
comedy and satire find place. The most prominent example is the
figure of Titivillus in the Towneley cycle.</p>

<p>In the early moralities the devil is still of primary importance,
and is always serious. But as the Vice became a more and more
prominent figure, the devil became less and less so, and in the later
drama his part is always subordinate. The play of <i>Nature</i> (c. 1500)
is the first morality without a devil. Out of fifteen moralities of
later date tabulated by Cushman, only four are provided with this character.</p>

<p>The degeneration of the devil as a dramatic figure was inevitable.
His grotesque appearance, at first calculated to inspire terror, by
its very exaggeration produced, when once familiar, a wholly comic
effect. When the active comic parts were assumed by the Vice, he
became a mere butt, and finally disappears.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the earliest comic figures in the religious drama
is that of the clumsy or uncouth servant.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Closely allied to him is the under-devil, who appears as early as
<i>The Harrowing of Hell</i>, and this figure is constantly employed
as a comic personage in the later drama.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
The figure of the servant later developed into that of the clown,
and in this type the character of the devil finally merged.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<h5><a name="Sect_C_I_2"></a>2. <i>Jonson’s Treatment of the Devil</i></h5>

<p>In the present play the devil-type is represented by the
arch-fiend Satan and his stupid subordinate, Pug. Of these two Satan
received more of the formal conventional elements of the older
drama, while Pug for the most part represents the later or clownish
figure. As in the morality-play Satan’s chief function is the
instruction of his emissary of evil. In no scene does he come into
contact with human beings, and he is always jealously careful for the
best interests of his state. In addition Jonson employs one purely
conventional attribute belonging to the tradition of the church- and
morality-plays. This is the cry of ‘Ho, ho!’, with which Satan makes
his entrance upon the stage in the first scene.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Other expressions of emotion were also used, but ‘Ho, ho!’ came in
later days to be recognized as the conventional cry of the fiend
upon making his entrance.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>How the character of Satan was to be represented is of course
impossible to determine. The devil in the pre-Shakespearian drama was
always a grotesque figure, often provided with the head of a beast and
a cow’s tail.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
In the presentation of Jonson’s play the ancient tradition was
probably followed. Satan’s speeches, however, are not undignified,
and too great grotesqueness of costume must have resulted in
considerable incongruity.</p>

<p>In the figure of Pug few of the formal elements of the
pre-Shakespearian devil are exhibited. He remains, of course, the
ostensible champion of evil, but is far surpassed by his earthly
associates, both in malice and in intellect. In personal appearance
he is brought by the assumption of the body and dress of a human
being into harmony with his environment. A single conventional
episode, with a reversal of the customary proceeding, is retained
from the morality-play. While Pug is languishing in prison, Iniquity
appears, Pug mounts upon his back, and is carried off to hell.
Iniquity comments upon it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Diuell was wont to carry away the euill;</span>
<span class="i0">But, now, the Euill out-carries the Diuell.</span>
</div></div>

<p>That the practice above referred to was a regular or even a
frequent feature of the morality-play has been disputed, but the
evidence seems fairly conclusive that it was common in the later and
more degenerate moralities. At any rate, like the cry of ‘Ho, ho!’ it
had come to be looked upon as part of the regular stock in trade, and
this was enough for Jonson’s purpose.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
This motive of the Vice riding the devil had changed from a passive
to an active comic part. Instead of the devil’s prey he had become
in the eyes of the spectators the devil’s tormentor. Jonson may be
looked upon as reverting, perhaps unconsciously, to the original and truer conception.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span></p>

<p>In other respects Pug exhibits only the characteristics of the
inheritor of the devil’s comedy part, the butt or clown. As we have
seen, one of the chief sources, as well as one of the constant modes
of manifestation, of this figure was the servant or man of low social
rank. Pug, too, on coming to earth immediately attaches himself to
Fitzdottrel as a servant, and throughout his brief sojourn on earth
he continues to exhibit the wonted stupidity and clumsy uncouthness
of the clown. He appears, to be sure, in a fine suit of clothes, but
he soon shows himself unfit for the position of gentleman-usher,
and his stupidity appears at every turn. The important element
in the clown’s comedy part, of a contrast between intention and
accomplishment, is of course exactly the sort of fun inspired by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
Pug’s repeated discomfiture. With the clown it often takes the
form of blunders in speech, and his desire to appear fine and say
the correct thing frequently leads him into gross absurdities.
This is brought out with broad humor in 4. 4. 219, where Pug, on
being catechized as to what he should consider ‘the height of his
employment’, stumbles upon the unfortunate suggestion: ‘To find
out a good <i>Corne-cutter</i>’. His receiving blows at the hand of his
master further distinguishes him as a clown. The investing of Pug
with such attributes was, as we have seen, no startling innovation on
Jonson’s part. Moreover, it fell into line with his purpose in this
play, and was the more acceptable since it allowed him to make use
of the methods of realism instead of forcing him to draw a purely
conventional figure. Pug, of course, even in his character of clown,
is not the unrelated stock-figure, introduced merely for the sake
of inconsequent comic dialogue and rough horse-play. His part is
important and definite, though not sufficiently developed.</p>

<h5><a name="Sect_C_I_3"></a>3. <i>The Influence of Robin
Goodfellow and of Popular Legend</i></h5>

<p>A constant element of the popular demonology was the belief in
the kobold or elfish sprite. This figure appears in the mysteries
in the shape of Titivillus, but is not found in the moralities.
Robin Goodfellow, however, makes his appearance in at least three
comedies, <i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, 1593-4, <i>Grim, the Collier
of Croyden</i>, c 1600, and <i>Wily Beguiled</i>, 1606. The last of these
especially approaches Jonson’s conception. Here Robin Goodfellow is
a malicious intriguer, whose nature, whether human or diabolical, is
left somewhat in doubt. His plans are completely frustrated, he is
treated with contempt, and is beaten by Fortunatus. The character was
a favorite with Jonson. In the masque of <i>The Satyr</i>, 1603,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
that character is addressed as Pug, which here seems evidently equivalent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
Puck or Robin Goodfellow. Similarly Thomas Heywood makes Kobald, Hobgoblin,
Robin Goodfellow, and Pug practically identical.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Butler, in the <i>Hudibras</i>,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
gives him the combination-title of good ‘Pug-Robin’. Jonson’s character
of Pug was certainly influenced in some degree both by
the popular and the literary conception of this ‘lubber fiend’.</p>

<p>The theme of a stupid or outwitted devil occurred also
both in ballad literature<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and in popular legend. Roskoff<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
places the change in attitude toward the devil from a feeling of fear
to one of superiority at about the end of the eleventh century. The
idea of a baffled devil may have been partially due to the legends
of the saints, where the devil is constantly defeated, though he is
seldom made to appear stupid or ridiculous. The notion of a ‘stupid
devil’ is not very common in English, but occasionally appears. In
the Virgilius legend the fiend is cheated of his reward by stupidly
putting himself into the physical power of the wizard. In the Friar
Bacon legend the necromancer delivers an Oxford gentleman by a trick
of sophistry.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
In the story upon which the drama of <i>The Merry Devil of Edmonton</i>
was founded, the devil is not only cleverly outwitted, but appears
weak and docile in his indulgence of the wizard’s plea for a
temporary respite. It may be said in passing, in spite of Herford’s
assertion to the contrary, that the supernatural machinery in this
play has considerably less connection with the plot than in <i>The
Devil is an Ass</i>. Both show a survival of a past interest, of which
the dramatist himself realizes the obsolete character.</p>

<h5><a name="Sect_C_I_4"></a>4. <i>Friar Rush and Dekker</i></h5>

<p>It was the familiar legend of Friar Rush which furnished
the groundwork of Jonson’s play. The story seems to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
of Danish origin, and first makes its appearance in England
in the form of a prose history during the latter half of
the sixteenth century. It is entered in the <i>Stationer’s Register</i>
1567-8, and mentioned by Reginald Scot in 1584.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
As early as 1566, however, the figure of Friar Rush on a
‘painted cloth’ was a familiar one, and is so mentioned in
<i>Gammer Gurton’s Needle</i>.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
The first extant edition dates from 1620, and has been reprinted
by W. J. Thoms.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
The character had already become partially identified with that
of Robin Goodfellow,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
and this identification, as we have seen, Jonson was inclined to accept.</p>

<p>In spite of many variations of detail the kernel of the Rush
story is precisely that of Jonson’s play, the visit of a devil to
earth with the purpose of corrupting men. Both Rush and Pug assume
human bodies, the former being ‘put in rayment like an earthly
creature’, while the latter is made subject ‘to all impressions of
the flesh’.</p>

<p>Rush, unlike his counterpart, is not otherwise bound to definite
conditions, but he too becomes a servant. The adventure is not of his
own seeking; he is chosen by agreement of the council, and no mention
is made of the emissary’s willingness or unwillingness to perform
his part. Later, however, we read that he stood at the gate of the
religious house ‘all alone and with a heavie countenance’. In the
beginning, therefore, he has little of Pug’s thirst for adventure,
but his object is at bottom the same, ‘to goe and dwell among these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
religious men for to maintaine them the longer in their ungracious
living’. Like Pug, whose request for a Vice is denied him, he goes
unaccompanied, and presents himself at the priory in the guise of a
young man seeking service: ‘Sir, I am a poore young man, and am out
of service, and faine would have a maister’.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Most of the remaining incidents of the Rush story could not
be used in Jonson’s play. Two incidents may be mentioned. Rush
furthers the amours of his master, as Pug attempts to do those
of his mistress. In the later history of Rush the motive of
demoniacal possession is worked into the plot. In a very important
respect, however, the legend differs from the play. Up to the time
of discovery Rush is popular and successful. He is nowhere made
ridiculous, and his mission of corruption is in large measure
fulfilled. The two stories come together in their conclusion. The
discovery that a real devil has been among them is the means of the
friars’ conversion and future right living. A precisely similar
effect takes place in the case of Fitzdottrel.</p>

<p>The legend of Friar Rush had already twice been used in the drama
before it was adopted by Jonson. The play by Day and Haughton to which
Henslowe refers<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
is not extant; Dekker’s drama, <i>If this be not a good Play, the
Diuell is in it</i>, appeared in 1612. Jonson in roundabout
fashion acknowledged his indebtedness to this play by the
closing line of his prologue.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;If this Play doe not like, the Diuell is in’t.</p>

<p>Dekker’s play adds few new elements to the story. The
first scene is in the infernal regions; not, however, the
Christian hell, as in the prose history, but the classical Hades.
This change seems to have been adopted from Machiavelli.
Three devils are sent to earth with the object of corrupting
men and replenishing hell. They return, on the whole, successful,
though the corrupted king of Naples is finally redeemed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span></p>

<p>In certain respects, however, the play stands closer to Jonson’s
drama than the history. In the first place, the doctrine that hell’s
vices are both old-fashioned and outdone by men, upon which Satan
lays so much stress in his instructions to Pug in the first scene,
receives a like emphasis in Dekker:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i19">... ’tis thought</span>
<span class="i0">That men to find hell, now, new waies have sought,</span>
<span class="i0">As Spaniards did to the Indies.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and again:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i21">... aboue vs dwell,</span>
<span class="i0">Diuells brauer, and more subtill then in Hell.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and finally:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They scorne thy hell, hauing better of their owne.</span>
</div></div>

<p>In the second place Lurchall, unlike Rush, but in the same
way as Pug, finds himself inferior to his earthly associates.
He acknowledges himself overreached by Bartervile, and confesses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I came to teach, but now (me thinkes) must learne.</span>
</div></div>

<p>A single correspondence of lesser importance may be added.
Both devils, when asked whence they come, obscurely intimate
their hellish origin. Pug says that he comes from the
Devil’s Cavern in Derbyshire. Rufman asserts that his
home is Helvetia.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<h5><a name="Sect_C_I_5"></a>5. <i>The Novella of Belfagor and the Comedy of Grim</i></h5>

<p>The relation between Jonson’s play and the novella attributed
to Niccolò Machiavelli (1469-1522) has been treated
in much detail by Dr. Ernst Hollstein. Dr. Hollstein
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
compares the play with the first known English translation,
that by the Marquis of Wharton in 1674.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
It is probable, however, that Jonson knew the novella in its Italian shape,
if he knew it at all.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
The Italian text has therefore been taken as the basis of the present
discussion, while Dr. Hollstein’s results, so far as they have
appeared adequate or important, have been freely used.</p>

<p>Both novella and play depart from the same idea, the visit of a
devil to earth to lead a human life. Both devils are bound by certain
definite conditions. Belfagor must choose a wife, and live with her
ten years; Pug must return at midnight. Belfagor, like Pug, must be
subject to ‘ogni infortunio nel quale gli uomini scorrono’.</p>

<p>In certain important respects Machiavelli’s story differs
essentially from Jonson’s. Both Dekker and Machiavelli place the
opening scene in the classical Hades instead of in the Christian
hell. But Dekker’s treatment of the situation is far more like
Jonson’s than is the novella’s. Herford makes the distinction
clear: ‘Macchiavelli’s Hades is the council-chamber of an Italian
Senate, Dekker’s might pass for some tavern haunt of Thames
watermen. Dekker’s fiends are the drudges of Pluto, abused for
their indolence, flogged at will, and peremptorily sent where he
chooses. Machiavelli’s are fiends whose advice he requests with the
gravest courtesy and deference, and who give it with dignity and
independence’. Further, the whole object of the visit, instead of
being the corruption of men, is a mere sociological investigation.
Pug is eager to undertake his mission; Belfagor is chosen by lot, and
very loath to go. Pug becomes a servant, Belfagor a nobleman.</p>

<p>But in one very important matter the stories coincide,
that of the general character and fate of the two devils.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
As Hollstein points out, each comes with a firm resolve
to do his best, each finds at once that his opponents are
too strong for him, each through his own docility and
stupidity meets repulse after repulse, ending in ruin, and
each is glad to return to hell. This, of course, involves
the very essence of Jonson’s drama, and on its resemblance
to the novella must be based any theory that Jonson was
familiar with the latter.</p>

<p>Of resemblance of specific details not much can be made.
The two stories have in common the feature of demoniacal
possession, but this, as we have seen, occurs also in the
Rush legend. The fact that the princess speaks Latin,
while Fitzdottrel surprises his auditors by his ‘several languages’,
is of no more significance. This is one of the
stock indications of witchcraft. It is mentioned by Darrel,
and Jonson could not have overlooked a device so obvious.
Certain other resemblances pointed out by Dr. Hollstein are
of only the most superficial nature. On the whole we are
not warranted in concluding with any certainty that Jonson
knew the novella at all.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he must have been acquainted with
the comedy of <i>Grim, the Collier of Croydon</i> (c 1600).
Herford makes no allusion to this play, and, though it was
mentioned as a possible source by A. W. Ward,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
the subject has never been investigated. The author of <i>Grim</i>
uses the Belfagor legend for the groundwork of his plot, but handles
his material freely. In many respects the play is a close
parallel to <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>. The same respect for the
vices of earth is felt as in Dekker’s and Jonson’s plays.
Belphegor sets out to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i17">... make experiment</span>
<span class="i0">If hell be not on earth as well as here.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The circumstances of the sending bear a strong resemblance to the instructions given to Pug:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou shalt be subject unto human chance,</span>
<span class="i0">So far as common wit cannot relieve thee.</span>
<span class="i0">But whatsover happens in that time,</span>
<span class="i0">Look not from us for succour or relief.</span>
<span class="i0">This shalt thou do, and when the time’s expired,</span>
<span class="i0">Bring word to us what thou hast seen and done.</span>
</div></div>

<p>So in Jonson:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">... but become subject</span>
<span class="i0">To all impression of the flesh, you take,</span>
<span class="i0">So farre as humane frailty: ...</span>
<span class="i0">But as you make your soone at nights relation,</span>
<span class="i0">And we shall find, it merits from the State,</span>
<span class="i0">You shall haue both trust from vs, and imployment.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Belphegor is described as ‘patient, mild, and pitiful’; and during
his sojourn on earth he shows little aptitude for mischief, but
becomes merely a butt and object of abuse. Belphegor’s request for
a companion, unlike that of Pug, is granted. He chooses his servant
Akercock, who takes the form of Robin Goodfellow. Robin expresses
many of the sentiments to be found in the mouth of Pug. With the
latter’s monologue (Text, 5. 2) compare Robin’s exclamation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Zounds, I had rather be in hell than here.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Neither Pug (Text, 2. 5. 3-4) nor Robin dares to return without authority:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What shall I do? to hell I dare not go,</span>
<span class="i0">Until my master’s twelve months be expir’d.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Like Pug (Text, 5. 6. 3-10) Belphegor worries over his reception in hell:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How shall I give my verdict up to Pluto</span>
<span class="i0">Of all these accidents?</span>
</div></div>

<p>Finally Belphegor’s sensational disappearance through the yawning
earth comes somewhat nearer to Jonson than does the Italian original.
The English comedy seems, indeed, to account adequately for all
traces of the Belfagor story to be found in Jonson’s play.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span></p>

<h5><a name="Sect_C_I_6"></a>6. <i>Summary</i></h5>

<p>It is certain that of the two leading ideas of Jonson’s comedy,
the sending of a devil to earth with the object of corrupting men
is derived from the Rush legend. It is probable that the no less
important motive of a baffled devil, happy to make his return
to hell, is due either directly or indirectly to Machiavelli’s
influence. This motive, as we have seen, was strengthened by a body
of legend and by the treatment of the devil in the morality play.</p>

<h5><a name="Sect_C_I_7"></a>7. <i>The Figure of the Vice</i></h5>

<p>It is the figure of the Vice which makes Jonson’s satire on the
out-of-date moralities most unmistakable. This character has been
the subject of much study and discussion, and there is to-day no
universally accepted theory as to his origin and development. In the
literature of Jonson’s day the term Vice is almost equivalent to
harlequin. But whether this element of buffoonery is the fundamental
trait of the character, and that of intrigue is due to a confusion
in the meaning of the word, or whether the element of intrigue is
original, and that of buffoonery has taken its place by a process of
degeneration in the Vice himself, is still a disputed question.</p>

<p>The theory of Cushman and of Eckhardt is substantially the same,
and may be stated as follows. Whether or not the Vice be a direct
descendant of the devil, it is certain that he falls heir to his
predecessor’s position in the drama, and that his development is
strongly influenced by that character. Originally, like the devil,
he represents the principle of evil and may be regarded as the
summation of the seven deadly sins. From the beginning, however,
he possessed more comic elements, much being ready made for him
through the partial degeneration of the devil, while the material of
the moralities was by no means so limited in scope as that of the
mysteries. This comic element, comparatively slight at first, soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
began to be cultivated intentionally, and gradually assumed the chief
function, while the allegorical element was largely displaced. In
course of time the transformation from the intriguer to the buffoon
became complete.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Moreover, the rapidity of the transformation was hastened by the
influence of the fool, a new dramatic figure of independent origin,
but the partial successor upon the stage of the Vice’s comedy part.
As early as 1570 the union of fool and Vice is plainly
visible.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
In 1576 we find express stage directions given for the Vice to
fill in the pauses with improvised jests.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Two years later a Vice plays the leading rôle for the last time.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
By 1584 the Vice has completely lost his character of intriguer<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>,
and in the later drama he appears only as an antiquated figure,
where he is usually considered as identical with the fool
or jester.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Cushman enumerates the three chief rôles of the Vice as the opponent
of the Good; the corrupter of man; and the buffoon.</p>

<p>The Vice, however, is not confined to the moralities, but
appears frequently in the comic interludes. According to
the theory of Cushman, the name Vice stands in the beginning
for a moral and abstract idea, that of the principle
of evil in the world, and must have originated in the
moralities; and since it is applied to a comic personage in
the interludes, this borrowing must have taken place after
the period of degeneration had already begun. To this
theory Chambers<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
offers certain important objections. He points out that, although
‘vices in the ordinary sense of the word are of course familiar
personages in the morals’, the term Vice is not applied specifically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
to a character in ‘any pre-Elizabethan moral interlude except the
Marian <i>Respublica</i>’, 1553. Furthermore, ‘as a matter of fact, he
comes into the interlude through the avenue of the farce’. The term
is first applied to the leading comic characters in the farces of
John Heywood, <i>Love</i> and <i>The Weather</i>, 1520-30. These characters
have traits more nearly resembling those of the fool and clown
than those of the intriguer of the moralities. Chambers concludes
therefore that ‘the character of the vice is derived from that of
the domestic fool or jester’, and that the term was borrowed by the
authors of the moralities from the comic interludes.</p>

<p>These two views are widely divergent, and seem at first
wholly irreconcilable. The facts of the case, however, are,
I believe, sufficiently clear to warrant the following conclusions:
(1) The early moralities possessed many allegorical
characters representing vices in the ordinary sense
of the word. (2) From among these vices we may distinguish
in nearly every play a single character as in a
preëminent degree the embodiment of evil. (3) To this
chief character the name of Vice was applied about 1553,
and with increasing frequency after that date. (4) Whatever
may have been the original meaning of the word, it
must have been generally understood in the moralities in
the sense now usually attributed to it; for (5) The term
was applied in the moralities only to a character in some
degree evil. Chambers instances <i>The Tide tarrieth for No
Man</i> and the tragedy of <i>Horestes</i>, where the Vice bears
the name of Courage, as exceptions. The cases, however,
are misleading. In the former, Courage is equivalent to
‘Purpose’, ‘Desire’, and is a distinctly evil character.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
In the latter he reveals himself in the second half of the play
as Revenge, and although he incites Horestes to an act of
justice, he is plainly opposed to ‘Amyte’, and he is finally
rejected and discountenanced. Moreover he is here a serious
figure, and only occasionally exhibits comic traits. He
cannot therefore be considered as supporting the theory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
of the original identity of the fool and the Vice. (6) The
Vice of the comic interludes and the leading character of
the moralities are distinct figures. The former was from
the beginning a comic figure or buffoon;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
the latter was in the beginning serious, and continued to the end to
preserve serious traits. With which of these two figures the term
Vice originated, and by which it was borrowed from the other, is
a matter of uncertainty and is of minor consequence. These facts,
however, seem certain, and for the present discussion sufficient:
that the vices of the earlier and of the later moralities represent
the same stock figure; that this figure stood originally for the
principle of evil, and only in later days became confused with
the domestic fool or jester; that the process of degeneration was
continuous and gradual, and took place substantially in the manner
outlined by Cushman and Eckhardt; and that, while to the playwright
of Jonson’s day the term was suggestive primarily of the buffoon,
it meant also an evil personage, who continued to preserve certain
lingering traits from the character of intriguer in the earlier moralities.</p>

<h5><a name="Sect_C_I_8"></a>8. <i>Jonson’s Use of the Vice</i></h5>

<p>The position of the Vice has been discussed at some length because
of its very important bearing on Jonson’s comedy. It is evident,
even upon a cursory reading, that Jonson has not confined himself to
the conception of the Vice obtainable from a familiarity with the
interludes alone, as shown in Heywood’s farces or the comedy of <i>Jack
Juggler</i>. The character of Iniquity, though fully identified with the
buffoon of the later plays, is nevertheless closely connected in the
author’s mind with the intriguer of the old moralities. This is clear
above all from the use of the name Iniquity, from his association
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
with the devil, and from Pug’s desire to use him as a means of
corrupting his playfellows. Thus, consciously or unconsciously on
Jonson’s part, Iniquity presents in epitome the history of the Vice.</p>

<p>His very name, as we have said, links him with the morality-play.
In fact, all the Vices suggested, Iniquity, Fraud, Covetousness, and
Lady Vanity, are taken from the moralities. The choice of Iniquity
was not without meaning, and was doubtless due to its more general
and inclusive significance. In Shakespeare’s time Vice and Iniquity
seem to have been synonymous terms (see Schmidt), from which it has
been inferred that Iniquity was the Vice in many lost moralities.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Of the original Vice-traits Iniquity lays vigorous claim to that
of the corrupter of man. Pug desires a Vice that he may ‘practice
there-with any play-fellow’, and Iniquity comes upon the stage with
voluble promises to teach his pupil to ‘cheat, lie, cog and swagger’.
He offers also to lead him into all the disreputable precincts of
the city. Iniquity appears in only two scenes, Act 1. Sc. 1 and Act
5. Sc. 6. In the latter he reverses the usual process and carries
away the devil to hell. This point has already been discussed (p. xxiv).</p>

<p>Aside from these two particulars, Iniquity is far nearer to the
fool than to the original Vice. As he comes skipping upon the stage
in the first scene, reciting his galloping doggerel couplets, we see
plainly that the element of buffoonery is uppermost in Jonson’s mind.
Further evidence may be derived from the particularity with which
Iniquity describes the costume which he promises to Pug, and which
we are doubtless to understand as descriptive of his own. Attention
should be directed especially to the wooden dagger, the long cloak,
and the slouch hat. Cushman says (p. 125): ‘The vice enjoys the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>
greatest freedom in the matter of dress; he is not confined to any
stereotyped costume; &emsp;... the opinion that he is always or
usually dressed in a fool’s costume has absolutely no justification’.
The wooden dagger, a relic of the Roman stage,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
is the most frequently mentioned article of equipment. It is first
found (1553-8) as part of the apparel of Jack Juggler in a print
illustrating that play, reproduced by Dodsley. It is also mentioned
in <i>Like Will to Like</i>, <i>Hickescorner</i>, <i>King Darius</i>, etc.
The wooden dagger was borrowed, however, from the fool’s costume, and
is an indication of the growing identification of the Vice with the
house-fool. That Jonson recognized it as such is evident from his
<i>Expostulation with Inigo Jones</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No velvet suit you wear will alter kind;</span>
<span class="i0">A wooden dagger is a dagger of wood.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The long cloak, twice mentioned (1. 1. 51 and 85), is
another property borrowed from the fool. The natural fool
usually wore a long gown-like dress,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
and this was later adopted as a dress for the artificial fool. Muckle
John, the court fool of Charles I., was provided with ‘a long coat
and suit of scarlet-colour  serge’.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Satan’s reply to Pug’s request for a Vice is, however, the most
important passage on this subject. He begins by saying that the Vice,
whom he identifies with the house fool, is fifty years out of date.
Only trivial and absurd parts are left for Iniquity to play, the
mountebank tricks of the city and the tavern fools. Douce (pp. 499 f.)
mentions nine kinds of fools, among which the following appear:
1. The general domestic fool. 4. The city or corporation fool. 5.
Tavern fools. Satan compares Iniquity with each of these in turn.
The day has gone by, he says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When euery great man had his <i>Vice</i> stand by him,</span>
<span class="i0">In his long coat, shaking his wooden dagger.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Then he intimates that Iniquity may be able to play the tavern fool:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where canst thou carry him? except to Tauernes?</span>
<span class="i0">To mount vp ona joynt-stoole, with a <i>Iewes</i>-trumpe,</span>
<span class="i0">To put downe <i>Cokeley</i>, and that must be to Citizens?</span>
</div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And finally he compares him with the city fool:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hee may perchance, in taile of a Sheriffes dinner,</span>
<span class="i0">Skip with a rime o’ the table, from <i>New-nothing</i>,</span>
<span class="i0">And take his <i>Almaine</i>-leape into a custard.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus not only does Jonson identify the Vice with the fool, but
with the fool in his senility. The characteristic functions of
the jester in the Shakespearian drama, with his abundant store of
improvised jests, witty retorts, and irresistible impudence, have no
part in this character. He is merely the mountebank who climbs upon
a tavern stool, skips over the table, and leaps into corporation custards.</p>

<p>Iniquity, then, plays no real part in the drama. His introduction
is merely for the purpose of satire. In <i>The Staple of News</i> the
subject is renewed, and treated with greater directness:</p>

<p>‘<i>Tat.</i> I would fain see the fool, gossip; the fool is the finest
man in the company, they say, and has all the wit: he is the very
justice o’ peace o’ the play, and can commit whom he will and what he
will, error, absurdity, as the toy takes him, and no man say black is
his eye, but laugh at him’.</p>

<p>In <i>Epigram 115, On the Town’s Honest Man</i>, Jonson again
identifies the Vice with the mountebank, almost in the same way as he
does in <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i17">... this is one</span>
<span class="i0">Suffers no name but a description</span>
<span class="i0">Being no vicious person but the Vice</span>

<span class="i0">At every meal, where it doth dine or sup,</span>
<span class="i0">The cloth’s no sooner gone, but it gets up,</span>
<span class="i0">And shifting of its faces, doth play more</span>
<span class="i0">Parts than the Italian could do with his door.</span>
<span class="i0">Acts old Iniquity and in the fit</span>

<h4><a name="Sect_C_II"></a>II. THE SATIRICAL DRAMA</h4>

<p>It was from Aristophanes<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
that Jonson learned to combine with such boldness the palpable with
the visionary, the material with the abstract. He surpassed even his
master in the power of rendering the combination a convincing one,
and his method was always the same. Fond as he was of occasional
flights of fancy, his mind was fundamentally satirical, so that the
process of welding the apparently discordant elements was always
one of rationalizing the fanciful rather than of investing the
actual with a far-away and poetic atmosphere. Thus even his purely
supernatural scenes present little incongruity. Satan and Iniquity
discuss strong waters and tobacco, Whitechapel and Billingsgate,
with the utmost familiarity; even hell’s ‘most exquisite tortures’
are adapted in part from the homely proverbs of the people. In the
use of his sources three tendencies are especially noticeable: the
motivation of borrowed incidents; the adjusting of action on a moral
basis: the reworking of his own favorite themes and incidents.</p>

<h5><a name="Sect_C_II_1"></a>1. <i>General Treatment of the Plot</i></h5>

<p>For the main plot we have no direct source. It represents,
however, Jonson’s typical method. It has been pointed out<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
that the characteristic Jonsonian comedy always consists of two
groups, the intriguers and the victims. In <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>
the most purely comic motive of the play is furnished by a reversal
of the usual relation subsisting between these two groups. Here
the devil, who was wont to be looked upon as arch-intriguer, is
constantly ‘fooled off and beaten’, and thus takes his position
as the comic butt. Pug, in a sense, represents a satirical trend.
Through him Jonson satirizes the outgrown supernaturalism which
still clung to the skirts <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii"
id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span> of Jacobean realism, and at the
same time paints in lively colors the vice of a society against
which hell itself is powerless to contend. It is only, however, in
a general way, where the devil stands for a principle, that Pug may
be considered as in any degree satirical. In the particular incident
he is always a purely comic figure, and furnishes the mirth which
results from a sense of the incongruity between anticipation and accomplishment.</p>

<p>Fitzdottrel, on the other hand, is mainly satirical.
Through him Jonson passes censure upon the city gallant,
the attendant at the theatre, the victim of the prevalent
superstitions, and even the pretended demoniac. His
dupery, as in the case of his bargain with Wittipol, excites
indignation rather than mirth, and his final discomfiture
affords us almost a sense of poetic justice. This character
stands in the position of chief victim.</p>

<p>In an intermediate position are Merecraft and Everill.
They succeed in swindling Fitzdottrel and Lady Tailbush,
but are in turn played upon by the chief intriguer, Wittipol,
with his friend Manly. Jonson’s moral purpose is here
plainly visible, especially in contrast to Plautus, with whom
the youthful intriguer is also the stock figure. The motive
of the young man’s trickery in the Latin comedy is usually
unworthy and selfish. That of Wittipol, on the other hand,
is wholly disinterested, since he is represented as having
already philosophically accepted the rejection of his
advances at the hands of Mrs. Fitzdottrel.</p>

<p>In construction the play suffers from overabundance of
material. Instead of a single main line of action, which
is given clear precedence, there is rather a succession of
elaborated episodes, carefully connected and motivated, but
not properly subordinated. The plot is coherent and intricate
rather than unified. This is further aggravated by
the fact that the chief objects of satire are imperfectly
understood by readers of the present day.</p>

<p>Jonson observes unity of time, Pug coming to earth in
the morning and returning at midnight. With the exception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>
of the first scene, which is indeterminate, and seems at
one moment to be hell, and the next London, the action is
confined to the City, but hovers between Lincoln’s Inn,
Newgate, and the house of Lady Tailbush. Unity of action
is of course broken by the interference of the devil-plot and
the episodic nature of the satirical plot. The main lines
of action may be discussed separately.</p>

<p>In the first act chief prominence is given to the intrigue between
Wittipol and Mrs. Fitzdottrel. This interest is continued through the
second act, but practically dropped after this point. In Act 4 we
find that both lovers have recovered from their infatuation, and the
intrigue ends by mutual consent.</p>

<p>The second act opens with the episode of Merecraft’s plot to
gull Fitzdottrel. The project of the dukedom of Drownedland is
given chief place, and attention is centred upon it both here and
in the following scenes. Little use, however, is made of it in the
motivation of action. This is left for another project, the office of
the Master of Dependencies (quarrels) in the next act. This device
is introduced in an incidental way, and we are not prepared for
the important place which it takes in the development of the plot.
Merecraft, goaded by Everill, hits upon it merely as a temporary
makeshift to extort money from Fitzdottrel. The latter determines
to make use of the office in prosecuting his quarrel with Wittipol.
In preparation for the duel, and in accordance with the course of
procedure laid down by Everill, he resolves to settle his estate.
Merecraft and Everill endeavor to have the deed drawn in their own
favor, but through the interference of Wittipol the whole estate is
made over to Manly, who restores it to Mrs. Fitzdottrel. This project
becomes then the real turning-point of the play.</p>

<p>The episode of Guilthead and Plutarchus in Act 3 is only slightly
connected with the main plot. That of Wittipol’s disguise as a
Spanish lady, touched upon in the first two acts, becomes the chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span>
interest of the fourth. It furnishes much comic material, and the
characters of Lady Tailbush and Lady Eitherside offer the poet the
opportunity for some of his cleverest touches in characterization and
contrast.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
The scene, however, is introduced for incidental purposes, the
satirization of foreign fashions and the follies of London society,
and is overelaborated. The catalogue of cosmetics is an instance of
Jonson’s intimate acquaintance with recondite knowledge standing in
the way of his art.</p>

<p>Merecraft’s ‘after game’ in the fifth act is of the nature of an
appendix. The play might well have ended with the frustration of his
plan to get possession of the estate. This act is introduced chiefly
for the sake of a satire upon pretended demoniacs and witch-finders.
It also contains the conclusion of the devil-plot.</p>

<p><i>The Devil is an Ass</i> will always remain valuable as a historical
document, and as a record of Jonson’s own attitude towards the abuses
of his times. In the treatment of Fitzdottrel and Merecraft among the
chief persons, and of Plutarchus Guilthead among the lesser, this
play belongs to Jonson’s  character-drama.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
It does not, however, belong to the pure humor-comedy. Like <i>The
Alchemist</i>, and in marked contrast to <i>Every Man out of his Humor</i>,
interest is sought in plot development. In the scene between Lady
Tailbush and Lady Eitherside, the play becomes a comedy of manners,
and in its attack upon state abuses it is semi-political in nature.
Both Gifford and Swinburne have observed the ethical treatment of the
main motives.</p>

<p>With the exception of Prologue and Epilogue, the doggerel couplets
spoken by Iniquity, Wittipol’s song (2. 6. 94), and some of the lines
quoted by Fitzdottrel in the last scene, the play is written in blank
verse throughout. Occasional lines of eight (2. 2. 122), nine (2. 1. 1),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span>
twelve (1. 1. 33) or thirteen (1. 1. 113) syllables are introduced.
Most of these could easily be normalized by a slight emendation or
the slurring of a syllable in pronunciation. Many of the lines,
however, are rough and difficult of scansion. Most of the dialogue
is vigorous, though Wittipol’s language is sometimes affected and
unnatural (cf. Act 1. Sc. 1). His speech, 1. 6. 111-148, is classical
in tone, but fragmentary and not perfectly assimilated. The song
already referred to possesses delicacy and some beauty of imagery,
but lacks Jonson’s customary polish and smoothness.</p>

<p>As a work of art the play must rely chiefly upon the vigor of its
satiric dialogue and the cleverness of its character sketches. It
lacks the chief excellences of construction&mdash;unity of interest,
subordination of detail, steady and uninterrupted development, and
prompt conclusion.</p>

<h5><a name="Sect_C_II_2"></a>2. <i>Chief Sources of the Plot</i></h5>

<p>The first source to be pointed out was that of Act 1.
Sc. 4-6.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
This was again noticed by Koeppel, who mentions one of the
word-for-word borrowings, and points out the moralistic tendency in
Jonson’s treatment of the husband, and his rejection of the Italian
story’s licentious  conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
The original is from Boccaccio’s <i>Decameron</i>, the fifth novella
of the third day. Boccaccio’s title is as follows: ‘Il Zima dona
a messer Francesco Vergellesi un suo pallafreno, e per quello con
licenzia di lui parla alla sua donna, ed ella tacendo, egli in
persona di lei si risponde, e secondo la sua risposta poi l’effetto
segue’. The substance of the story is this. Il Zima, with the bribe
of a palfrey, makes a bargain with Francesco. For the gift he is
granted an interview with the wife of Francesco and in the latter’s
presence. This interview, however, unlike that in <i>The Devil is an
Ass</i>, is not in the husband’s hearing. To guard against any mishap,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span>
Francesco secretly commands his wife to make no answer to the lover,
warning her that he will be on the lookout for any communication on
her part. The wife, like Mrs. Fitzdottrel, upbraids her husband,
but is obliged to submit. Il Zima begins his courtship, but, though
apparently deeply affected, she makes no answer. The young man then
suspects the husband’s trick (e poscia s’incominciò ad accorgere
dell’ arte usata dal cavaliere). He accordingly hits upon the device
of supposing himself in her place and makes an answer for her,
granting an assignation. As a signal he suggests the hanging out of
the window of two handkerchiefs. He then answers again in his own
person. Upon the husband’s rejoining them he pretends to be deeply
chagrined, complains that he has met a statue of marble (una statua
di marmo) and adds: ‘Voi avete comperato il pallafreno, e io non l’ho
venduto’. Il Zima is successful in his ruse, and Francesco’s wife
yields completely to his seduction.</p>

<p>A close comparison of this important source is highly instructive.
Verbal borrowings show either that Jonson had the book before him, or
that he remembered many of the passages literally. Thus Boccaccio’s
‘una statua di marmo’ finds its counterpart in a later
scene<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
where Mrs. Fitzdottrel says: ‘I would not haue him thinke hee met a
statue’. Fitzdottrel’s satisfaction at the result of the bargain is
like that of Francesco: ‘I ha’ kept the contract, and the cloake is
mine’ (omai è ben mio il pallafreno, che fu tuo). Again Wittipol’s
parting words resemble Il Zima’s: ‘It may fall out, that you ha’
bought it deare, though I ha’ not sold it’.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
In the mouths of the two heroes, however, these words mean exactly
opposite things. With Il Zima it is a complaint, and means: ‘You have
won the cloak, but I have got nothing in return’. With Wittipol,
on the other hand, it is an open sneer, and hints at further
developments. The display of handkerchiefs at the window is
another borrowing. Fitzdottrel says sarcastically:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">... I’ll take carefull order,</span>
<span class="i0">That shee shall hang forth ensignes at the window.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Finally Wittipol, like Il Zima, suspects a trick when
Mrs. Fitzdottrel refuses to answer:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How! not any word? Nay, then, I taste a tricke in’t.</span>
</div></div>

<p>But precisely here Jonson blunders badly. In Boccaccio’s story
the trick was a genuine one. Il Zima stands waiting for an answer.
When no response is made he begins to suspect the husband’s secret
admonition, and to thwart it hits upon the device of answering
himself. But in Jonson there is no trick at all. Fitzdottrel
does indeed require his wife to remain silent, but by no means
secretly. His command is placed in the midst of a rambling discourse
addressed alternately to his wife and to the young men. There is
not the slightest hint that any part of this speech is whispered in
his wife’s ear, and Wittipol enters upon his courtship with full
knowledge of the situation. This fact deprives Wittipol’s speech in
the person of Mrs. Fitzdottrel of its character as a clever device,
so that the whole point of Boccaccio’s story is weakened, if not
destroyed. I cannot refrain in conclusion from making a somewhat
doubtful conjecture. It is noticeable that while Jonson follows so
many of the details of this story with the greatest fidelity he
substitutes the gift of a cloak for that of the original ‘pallafreno’
(palfrey).<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
The word is usually written ‘palafreno’ and so occurs in Florio. Is
it possible that Jonson was unfamiliar with the word, and, not being
able to find it in a dictionary, conjectured that it was identical
with ‘palla’, a cloak?</p>

<p>In other respects Jonson’s handling of the story displays
his characteristic methods. Boccaccio spends very few words in
description of either husband or suitor. Jonson, however, is careful
to make plain the despicable character of Fitzdottrel, while
Wittipol is represented as an attractive and high-minded young man.
Further than this, both Mrs. Fitzdottrel and Wittipol soon recover
completely from their infatuation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span></p>

<p>Koeppel has suggested a second source from the <i>Decameron</i>,
Day 3, Novella 3. The title is: ‘Sotto spezie di confessione e di
purissima coscienza una donna, innamorata d’un giovane, induce un
solenne frate, senza avvedersene egli, a dar modo che’l piacer di lei
avessi intero effetto’. The story is briefly this. A lady makes her
confessor the means of establishing an acquaintance with a young man
with whom she has fallen in love. Her directions are conveyed to him
under the guise of indignant prohibitions. By a series of messages
of similar character she finally succeeds in informing him of the
absence of her husband and the possibility of gaining admittance to
her chamber by climbing a tree in the garden. Thus the friar becomes
the unwitting instrument of the very thing which he is trying to
prevent. So in Act 2. Sc. 2 and 6, Mrs. Fitzdottrel suspects Pug of
being her husband’s spy. She dares not therefore send Wittipol a
direct message, but requests him to cease his attentions to her</p>

<span class="i0">At the Gentlemans chamber-window in <i>Lincolnes-Inne</i> there,</span>
<span class="i0">That opens to my gallery.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Wittipol takes the hint, and promptly appears at the place indicated.</p>

<p>Von Rapp<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
has mentioned certain other scenes as probably of Italian origin,
but, as he advances no proofs, his suggestions may be neglected. It
seems to me possible that in the scene above referred to, where the
lover occupies a house adjoining that of his mistress, and their
secret amour is discovered by her servant and reported to his master,
Jonson had in mind the same incident in Plautus’ <i>Miles Gloriosus</i>,
Act. 2. Sc. 1 f.</p>

<p>The trait of jealousy which distinguishes Fitzdottrel was
suggested to some extent by the character of Euclio in the
<i>Aulularia</i>, and a passage of considerable length<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> is freely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span>
paraphrased from that play. The play and the passage
had already been used in <i>The Case is Altered</i>.</p>

<p>Miss Woodbridge has noticed that the scene in which Lady Tailbush
and her friends entertain Wittipol disguised as a Spanish lady is
similar to Act 3. Sc. 2 of <i>The Silent Woman</i>, where the collegiate
ladies call upon Epicoene. The trick of disguising a servant as a
woman occurs in Plautus’ <i>Casina</i>, Acts 4 and 5.</p>

<p>For the final scene, where Fitzdottrel plays the part of a
bewitched person, Jonson made free use of contemporary books and
tracts. The motive of pretended possession had already appeared in
<i>The Fox</i> (<i>Wks.</i> 3. 312), where symptoms identical with or
similar to those in the present passage are mentioned&mdash;swelling
of the belly, vomiting crooked pins, staring of the eyes, and foaming
at the mouth. The immediate suggestion in this place may have come
either through the Rush story or through Machiavelli’s novella.
That Jonson’s materials can be traced exclusively to any one source
is hardly to be expected. Not only were trials for witchcraft
numerous, but they must have formed a common subject of speculation
and discussion. The ordinary evidences of possession were doubtless
familiar to the well-informed man without the need of reference to
particular records. And it is of the ordinary evidences that the
poet chiefly makes use. Nearly all these are found repeatedly in the
literature of the period.</p>

<p>We know, on the other hand, that Jonson often preferred to get
his information through the medium of books. It is not surprising,
therefore, that Merecraft proposes to imitate ‘little Darrel’s
tricks’, and to find that the dramatist has resorted in large measure
to this particular source.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The Darrel controversy was carried on through a number
of years between John Darrel, a clergyman (see note
<a href="#Note_5_3_6">5. 3. 6</a>), on the one hand, and Bishop Samuel Harsnet,
John Deacon and John Walker, on the other. Of the tracts produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span>
in this controversy the two most important are
Harsnet’s <i>Discovery of the Fraudulent Practises of John
Darrel</i>,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
1599, and Darrel’s <i>True Narration of the Strange and Grevous
Vexation by the Devil of 7 Persons in Lancashire and William Somers
of Nottingham</i>, ... 1600. The story is retold in Francis Hutchinson’s
<i>Historical Essay concerning Witchcraft</i>, London, 1720.</p>

<p>Jonson follows the story as told in these two books with
considerable fidelity. The accompaniments of demonic
possession which Fitzdottrel exhibits in the last scene are
enumerated in two previous speeches. Practically all of
these are to be found in Darrel’s account:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">... roule but wi’ your eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">And foam at th’ mouth.&emsp;(Text, 5. 3. 2-3)</span>
<span class="i11">... to make your belly swell,</span>
<span class="i0">And your eyes turne, to foame, to stare, to gnash</span>
<span class="i0">Your teeth together, and to beate your selfe,</span>
<span class="i0">Laugh loud, and faine six voices.&emsp;(5. 5. 25 f.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>They may be compared with the description given by Darrel: ‘He was
often seene ... to beate his head and other parts of his body against
the ground and bedstead. In most of his fitts, he did swell in his
body; ... if he were standing when the fit came he wold be cast
headlong upon the ground, or fall doune, drawing then his lips awry,
gnashing with his teeth, wallowing and foaming.... Presently after he
would laughe loud and shrill, his mouth being shut close’. (Darrel,
p. 181.) ‘He was also continually torne in very fearfull manner, and
disfigured in his face ... now he gnashed with his teeth;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[li]</a></span>
now he fomed like to the horse or boare, ... not to say anything of
his fearfull staring with his eyes, and incredible gaping’. (Darrel,
p. 183.) The swelling, foaming, gnashing, staring, etc., are also
mentioned by Harsnet (pp. 147-8), as well as the jargon of languages
(p. 165).</p>

<p>The scene is prepared before Merecraft’s appearance (Text, 5. 5. 40.
Cf. <i>Detection</i>, p. 92), and Fitzdottrel is discovered lying
in bed (Text, 5. 5. 39; 5. 8. 40). Similarly, Somers performed
many of his tricks ‘under a coverlet’ (<i>Detection</i>, p. 104). Sir
Paul Eitherside then enters and ‘interprets all’. This is imitated
directly from Harsnet, where we read: ‘So. [Somers] acting those
gestures M. Dar. did expound them very learnedlye, to signify this or
that sinne that raigned in Nott. [Nottingham].’ Paul’s first words
are: ‘This is the <i>Diuell</i> speakes and laughes in him’. So Harsnet
tells us that ‘M. Dar. vpon his first comming vnto Som. affirmed that
it was not So. that spake in his fitts, but the diuell by him’. Both
Fitzdottrel (Text, 5. 8. 115) and Somers (<i>Narration</i>, p. 182) talk
in Greek. The devil in Fitzdottrel proposes to ‘break his necke in
jest’ (Text, 5. 8. 117), and a little later to borrow money (5. 8.
119). The same threat is twice made in the <i>True Narration</i>
(pp. 178 and 180). In the second of these passages Somers is met by an
old woman, who tries to frighten him into giving her money. Otherwise,
she declares, ‘I will throwe thee into this pit, and breake thy
neck’. The mouse ‘that should ha’ come forth’ (Text, 5. 8. 144) is
mentioned by both narrators (<i>Detection</i>, p. 140; <i>Narration</i>,
p. 184), and the pricking of the body with pins and needles (Text,
5. 8. 49) is found in slightly altered form (<i>Detection</i>, p. 135;
<i>Narration</i>, p. 174). Finally the clapping of the hands (Text.
5. 8. 76) is a common feature (<i>Narration</i>, p. 182). The last
mentioned passage finds a still closer parallel in a couplet from
the contemporary ballad, which Gifford quotes from Hutchinson (p. 249):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And by the clapping of his Hands</span>
<span class="i0">He shew’d the starching of our Bands.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[lii]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of the apparatus supplied by Merecraft for the imposture, the
soap, nutshell, tow, and touchwood (Text, 5. 3. 3-5), the bladders
and bellows (Text, 5. 5. 48), some are doubtless taken from Harsnet’s
<i>Discovery</i>, though Darrel does not quote these passages in the
<i>Detection</i>. We find, however, that Darrel was accused of supplying
Somers with black lead to foam with (<i>Detection</i>, p. 160), and
Gifford says that the <i>soap</i> and <i>bellows</i> are also mentioned in the
‘Bishop’s book’.</p>

<p>Though Jonson drew so largely upon this source, many details are
supplied by his own imagination. Ridiculous as much of it may seem to
the modern reader, it is by no means overdrawn. In fact it may safely
be affirmed that no such realistic depiction of witchcraft exists
elsewhere in the whole range of dramatic literature.</p>

<h5><a name="Sect_C_II_3"></a>3. <i>Prototypes of the leading Characters</i></h5>

<p>The position of the leading characters has already been indicated.
Pug, as the comic butt and innocent gull, is allied to Master Stephen
and Master Matthew of <i>Every Man in his Humor</i>, Dapper of <i>The
Alchemist</i>, and Cokes of <i>Bartholomew Fair</i>. Fitzdottrel, another
type of the gull, is more closely related to <i>Tribulation Wholesome</i>
in <i>The Alchemist</i>, and even in some respects to Corvino and Voltore
in <i>The Fox</i>. Wittipol and Manly, the chief intriguers, hold
approximately the same position as Wellbred and Knowell in <i>Every
Man in his Humor</i>, Winwife and Quarlous in <i>Bartholomew Fair</i>, and
Dauphine, Clerimont, and Truewit in <i>The Silent Woman</i>. Merecraft is
related in his character of swindler to Subtle in <i>The Alchemist</i>,
and in his character of projector to Sir Politick Wouldbe in <i>The
Fox</i>.</p>

<p>The contemptible ‘lady of spirit and woman of fashion’ is one of
Jonson’s favorite types. She first appears in the persons of Fallace
and Saviolina in <i>Every Man out of his Humor</i>; then in <i>Cynthia’s
Revels</i>, where Moria and her friends play the part; then as Cytheris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[liii]</a></span>
in <i>Poetaster</i>, Lady Politick in <i>The Alchemist</i>, the collegiate
ladies in <i>The Silent Woman</i>, and Fulvia and Sempronia in <i>Catiline</i>.
The same affectations and vices are satirized repeatedly. An evident
prototype of Justice Eitherside is found in the person of Adam
Overdo in <i>Bartholomew Fair</i>. Both are justices of the peace, both
are officious, puritanical, and obstinate. Justice Eitherside’s
denunciation of the devotees of tobacco finds its counterpart in
a speech in <i>Bartholomew Fair</i>, and his repeated ‘I do detest it’
reminds one of Overdo’s frequent expressions of horror at the
enormities which he constantly discovers.</p>

<h5><a name="Sect_C_II_4"></a>4. <i>Minor Sources</i></h5>

<p><i>The Devil is an Ass</i> is not deeply indebted to the classics.
Jonson borrows twice from Horace, 1. 6. 131, and 2. 4. 27 f. The
half dozen lines in which the former passage occurs (1. 6. 126-132)
are written in evident imitation of the Horatian style. Two passages
are also borrowed from Plautus, 2. 1. 168 f., already mentioned, and
3. 6. 38-9. A single passage (2. 6. 104 f.) shows the influence of
Martial. These passages are all quoted in the notes.</p>

<p>The source of Wittipol’s description of the ‘Cioppino’, and the
mishap attendant upon its use, was probably taken from a contemporary
book of travels. A passage in Coryat’s <i>Crudities</i> furnishes the
necessary information and a similar anecdote, and was doubtless used
by Jonson (see note <a href="#Note_4_4_69">4. 4. 69</a>). Coryat was patronized by the poet.
Similarly, another passage in the <i>Crudities</i> seems to have suggested
the project of the forks (see note <a href="#Note_5_4_17">5. 4. 17</a>).</p>

<p>A curious resemblance is further to be noted between several
passages in <i>The Devil is an Ass</i> and <i>Underwoods 62</i>. The first
draft of this poem may have been written not long before the present
play (see Fleay, <i>Chron.</i> 1. 329-30) and so have been still fresh in
the poet’s mind. The passage <i>DA.</i> 3. 2. 44-6 shows unmistakably that
the play was the borrower, and not the poem. Gifford suggests that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[liv]</a></span>
both passages were quoted from a contemporary posture-book, but the
passage in the epigram gives no indication of being a quotation.</p>

<p>The chief parallels are as follows: <i>U. 62.</i> 10-14 and <i>DA.</i> 3.
3. 165-6; <i>U. 62.</i> 21-2 and <i>DA.</i> 3. 3. 169-72; <i>U. 62.</i> 25-6 and
<i>DA.</i> 3. 2. 44-6; <i>U. 62.</i> 45-8 and <i>DA.</i> 2. 8. 19-22. These passages
are all quoted in the notes. In addition, there are a few striking
words and phrases that occur in both productions, but the important
likenesses are all noted above. In no other poem except <i>Charis</i>,
<i>The Gipsies</i>, and <i>Underwoods 36</i>,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
where the borrowings are unmistakably intentional, is there any thing
like the same reworking of material as in this instance.</p>

<h4><a name="Sect_C_III"></a>III. <span class="smcap">Specific Objects of Satire</span></h4>

<p><i>The Devil is an Ass</i> has been called of all Jonson’s plays
since <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i> the most obsolete in the subjects of
its satire.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
The criticism is true, and it is only with some knowledge of the
abuses which Jonson assails that we can appreciate the keenness and
precision of his thrusts. The play is a colossal exposé of social
abuses. It attacks the aping of foreign fashions, the vices of
society, and above all the cheats and impositions of the unscrupulous
swindler. But we miss its point if we fail to see that Jonson’s
arraignment of the society which permitted itself to be gulled is
no less severe than that of the swindler who practised upon its
credulity. Three institutions especially demand an explanation both
for their own sake and for their bearing upon the plot. These are the
duello, the monopoly, and the pretended demoniacal possession.</p>

<h5><a name="Sect_C_III_1"></a>1. <i>The Duello</i></h5>

<p>The origin of private dueling is a matter of some obscurity. It
was formerly supposed to be merely a development of the judicial duel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[lv]</a></span>
or combat, but this is uncertain. Dueling flourished on the
Continent, and was especially prevalent in France during the reign of
Henry III. Jonson speaks of the frequency of the practice in France
in <i>The Magnetic Lady</i>.</p>

<p>No private duel seems to have occurred in England before the
sixteenth century, and the custom was comparatively rare until
the reign of James I. Its introduction was largely due to the
substitution of the rapier for the broadsword. Not long after
this change in weapons fencing-schools began to be established
and were soon very popular. Donald Lupton, in his <i>London and the
Countrey carbonadoed</i>, 1632, says they were usually set up by
‘some low-country soldier, who to keep himself honest from further
inconveniences, as also to maintain himself, thought upon this course
and practises  it’.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The etiquette of the duel was a matter of especial concern. The
two chief authorities seem to have been Jerome Carranza, the author
of a book entitled <i>Filosofia de las Armas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
and Vincentio Saviolo, whose <i>Practise</i> was translated into English
in 1595. It contained two parts, the first ‘intreating of the vse of
the rapier and dagger’, the second ‘of honor and honorable quarrels’.
The rules laid down in these books were mercilessly ridiculed by the
dramatists; and the duello was a frequent subject of satire.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>By 1616 dueling must have become very common. Frequent
references to the subject are found about this time in
the <i>Calendar of State Papers</i>. Under date of December
9, 1613, we read that all persons who go abroad to fight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[lvi]</a></span>
duels are to be censured in the Star Chamber. On February 17, 1614,
‘a proclamation, with a book annexed’, was issued against duels, and
on February 13, 1617, the King made a Star Chamber speech against
dueling, ‘on which he before published a sharp edict’.</p>

<p>The passion for dueling was turned to advantage by a set of
improvident bravos, who styled themselves ‘sword-men’ or ‘masters
of dependencies,’ a <i>dependence</i> being the accepted name for an
impending quarrel. These men undertook to examine into the causes of
a duel, and to settle or ‘take it up’ according to the rules laid
down by the authorities on this subject. Their prey were the young
men of fashion in the city, and especially ‘country gulls’, who were
newly come to town and were anxious to become sophisticated. The
profession must have been profitable, for we hear of their methods
being employed by the ‘roaring boys’<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
and the masters of the fencing schools.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
Fletcher in <i>The Elder Brother</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 10. 283, speaks of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">... the masters of dependencies</span>
<span class="i0">That by compounding differences ’tween others</span>
<span class="i0">Supply their own necessities,</span>
</div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and Massinger makes similar comment in <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>Wks.</i>, p. 343:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">When two heirs quarrel,</span>
<span class="i0">The swordsmen of the city shortly after</span>
<span class="i0">Appear in plush, for their grave consultations</span>
<span class="i0">In taking up the difference; some, I know,</span>
<span class="i0">Make a set living on’t.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Another function of the office is mentioned by Ford in
<i>Fancies Chaste and Noble</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 241. The master
would upon occasion ‘brave’ a quarrel with the novice for
the sake of ‘gilding his reputation’, and Massinger in <i>The
Maid of Honor</i>, <i>Wks.</i>, p. 190, asserts that he would even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[lvii]</a></span>
consent ‘for a cloak with thrice-died velvet, and a cast suit’ to
be ‘kick’d down the stairs’. In <i>A King and No King</i>, B. &amp; Fl.,
<i>Wks.</i> 2. 310 f., Bessus consults with two of these ‘Gentlemen of
the Sword’ in a ridiculous scene, in which the sword-men profess the
greatest scrupulousness in examining every word and phrase, affirming
that they cannot be ‘too subtle in this business’.</p>

<p>Jonson never loses an opportunity of satirizing these despicable
bullies, who were not only ridiculous in their affectations, but who
proved by their ‘fomenting bloody quarrels’ to be no small danger
to the state. Bobadill, who is described as a Paul’s Man, was in
addition a pretender to this craft. Matthew complains that Downright
has threatened him with the bastinado, whereupon Bobadill cries out
immediately that it is ‘a most proper and sufficient dependence’ and
adds: ‘Come hither, you shall chartel him; I’ll shew you a trick or
two, you shall kill him with at pleasure’.<a name="FNanchor_72_72"
id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72"
class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Cavalier Shift, in <i>Every Man out of his
Humor</i>, among various other occupations has the reputation of being
able to ‘manage a quarrel the best that ever you saw, for terms
and circumstances’. We have an excellent picture of the ambitious
novice in the person of Kastrill in <i>The Alchemist</i>. Kastrill, who
is described as an ‘angry boy’, comes to consult Subtle as to how to
‘carry a business, manage a quarrel fairly’. Face assures him that
Dr. Subtle is able to ‘take the height’ of any quarrel whatsoever,
to tell ‘in what degree of safety it lies’, ‘how it may be borne’, etc.</p>

<p>From this description of the ‘master of dependencies’
the exquisite humor of the passage in <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>
(3. 3. 60 f.) can be appreciated. Merecraft assures Fitzdottrel
that this occupation, in reality the refuge only of
the Shifts and Bobadills of the city, is a new and important
office about to be formally established by the state. In
spite of all their speaking against dueling, he says, they
have come to see the evident necessity of a public tribunal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[lviii]</a></span>
to which all quarrels may be referred. It is by means of
this pretended office that Merecraft attempts to swindle
Fitzdottrel out of his entire estate, from which disaster he
is saved only by the clever interposition of Wittipol.</p>

<h5><a name="Sect_C_III_2"></a>2. <i>The Monopoly System</i></h5>

<p>Jonson’s severest satire in <i>The Devil is an Ass</i> is directed
against the projector. Through him the whole system of Monopolies is
indirectly criticised. To understand the importance and timeliness of
this attack, as well as the poet’s own attitude on the subject, it is
necessary to give a brief historical discussion of the system as it
had developed and then existed.</p>

<p>Royal grants with the avowed intention of instructing the English
in a new industry had been made as early as the fourteenth
century,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
and the system had become gradually modified during the Tudor
dynasty. In the sixteenth century a capitalist middle class rose to
wealth and political influence. During the reign of Elizabeth a large
part of Cecil’s energies was directed toward the economic development
of the country. This was most effectually accomplished by granting
patents to men who had enterprise enough to introduce a new art or
manufacture, whether an importation from a foreign country or their
own invention. The capitalist was encouraged to make this attempt by
the grant of special privileges of manufacture for a limited
period.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
The condition of monopoly did not belong to the
mediaeval system, but was first introduced under Elizabeth.
So far the system had its economic justification, but
unfortunately it did not stop here. Abuses began to creep
in. Not only the manufacture, but the exclusive trade in
certain articles, was given over to grantees, and commodities
of the most common utility were ‘ingrossed into the hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[lix]</a></span>
of these blood-suckers of the commonwealth.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
A remonstrance of Parliament was made to Elizabeth in 1597, and again
in 1601, and in consequence the Queen thought best to promise the
annulling of all monopolies then existing, a promise which she in
large measure fulfilled. But the immense growth of commerce under
Elizabeth made it necessary for her successor, James I., to establish
a system of delegation, and he accordingly adapted the system of
granting patents to the existing needs.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
Many new monopolies were granted during the early years of his reign,
but in 1607 Parliament again protested, and he followed Elizabeth’s
example by revoking them all. After the suspension of Parliamentary
government in 1614 the system grew up again, and the old abuses
became more obnoxious than ever. In 1621 Parliament addressed a
second remonstrance to James. The king professed ignorance, but
promised redress, and in 1624 all the existing monopolies were
abolished by the Statute 21 James I. c. 3. In Parliament’s address to
James ‘the tender point of prerogative’ was not disturbed, and it was
contrived that all the blame and punishment should fall on the
patentees.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Of all the patents granted during this time, that which seems
to have most attracted the attention of the dramatists was one for
draining the Fens of Lincolnshire. Similar projects had frequently
been attempted during the sixteenth century. In the list of patents
before 1597, catalogued by Hulme, seven deal with water drainage in
some form or other. The low lands on the east coast of England are
exposed to inundation.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
During the Roman occupation large embankments had been built, and
during the Middle Ages these had been kept up partly through a
commission appointed by the Crown, and partly through the efforts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[lx]</a></span>
the monasteries at Ramsey and Crowland. After the dissolution of
these monasteries it became necessary to take up anew the work of
reclaiming the fen-land. An abortive attempt by the Earl of Lincoln
had already been made when the Statute 43 Eliz. c. 10. 11. was passed
in the year 1601. This made legal the action of projectors in the
recovery of marsh land. Many difficulties, however, such as lack of
funds and opposition on the part of the inhabitants and neighbors of
the fens, still stood in their way. In 1605 Sir John Popham and Sir
Thomas Fleming headed a company which undertook to drain the Great
Level of the Cambridgeshire fens, consisting of more than 300,000
acres, at their own cost, on the understanding that 130,000 acres
of the reclaimed land should fall to their share. The project was a
complete failure. Another statute granting a patent for draining the
fens is found in the seventh year of Jac. I. c. 20, and the attempt
was renewed from time to time throughout the reigns of James and
Charles I. It was not, however, until the Restoration that these
efforts were finally crowned with success.</p>

<p>When the remonstrance was made to James in 1621, the object of the
petitioners was gained, as we have seen, by throwing all the blame
upon the patentees and projectors. Similarly, the dramatists often
prefer to make their attack, not by assailing the institution of
monopolies, but by ridicule of the offending subjects.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
Two agents are regularly distinguished. There is the patentee,
sometimes also called the projector, whose part it is to supply the
funds for the establishment of the monopoly, and, if possible, the
necessary influence at Court; and the actual projector or inventor,
who undertakes to furnish his patron with various projects of his own device.</p>

<p>Jonson’s is probably the earliest dramatic representation of the
projector. Merecraft is a swindler, pure and simple, whose schemes
are directed not so much against the people whom he aims to plunder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[lxi]</a></span>
by the establishment of a monopoly as against the adventurer who
furnishes the funds for putting the project into operation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">... Wee poore Gentlemen, that want acres,</span>
<span class="i0">Must for our needs, turne fooles vp and plough <i>Ladies</i>.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Both Fitzdottrel and Lady Tailbush are drawn into these schemes
so far as to part with their money. Merecraft himself pretends that
he possesses sufficient influence at Court. He flatters Fitzdottrel,
who is persuaded by the mere display of projects in a buckram bag, by
demanding of him ‘his count’nance, t’appeare in’t to great men’ (2.
1. 39). Lady Tailbush is not so easily fooled, and Merecraft has some
difficulty in persuading her of the power of his friends at Court
(Act 4. Sc. 1).</p>

<p>Merecraft’s chief project, the recovery of the drowned lands, is
also satirized by Randolph:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have a rare device to set Dutch windmills</span>
<span class="i0">Upon Newmarket Heath, and Salisbury Plain,</span>
<span class="i0">To drain the fens.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and in <i>Holland’s Leaguer</i>, Act 1. Sc. 5 (cited by Gifford):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i24">Our projector</span>
<span class="i0">Will undertake the making of bay salt,</span>
<span class="i0">For a penny a bushel, to serve all the state;</span>
<span class="i0">Another dreams of building waterworkes,</span>
<span class="i0">Drying of fenns and marshes, like the Dutchmen.</span>
</div></div>

<p>In the later drama the figure of the projector appears several
times, but it lacks the timeliness of Jonson’s satire, and the
conception must have been largely derived from literary sources.
Jonson’s influence is often apparent. In Brome’s <i>Court Beggar</i>
the patentee is Mendicant, a country gentleman who has left his
rustic life and sold his property, in order to raise his state
by court-suits. The projects which he presents at court are the
invention of three projectors. Like Merecraft, they promise to make
Mendicant a lord, and succeed only in reducing him to poverty. The
character of the Court Beggar is given in these words: ‘He is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[lxii]</a></span>
a Knight that hanckers about the court ambitious to make himselfe a
Lord by begging. His braine is all Projects, and his soule nothing
but Court-suits. He has begun more Knavish suits at Court, then ever
the Kings Taylor honestly finish’d, but never thriv’d by any: so that
now hee’s almost fallen from a Palace Begger to a Spittle one’.</p>

<p>In the <i>Antipodes</i> Brome introduces ‘a States-man studious
for the Commonwealth, solicited by Projectors of the Country’.
Brome’s list of projects (quoted in Gifford’s edition) is a broad
caricature. Wilson, in the Restoration drama, produced a play called
<i>The Projectors</i>, in which Jonson’s influence is apparent
(see Introduction, <a href="#Page_lxxv">p. lxxv</a>).</p>

<p>Among the <i>characters</i>, of which the seventeenth century writers
were so fond, the projector is a favorite figure. John  Taylor,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
the water-poet, furnishes us with a cartoon entitled ‘The complaint
of M. Tenterhooke the <i>Projector</i> and Sir <i>T</i>homas Dodger the
Patentee’. In the rimes beneath the picture the distinction between
the projector, who ‘had the Art to cheat the Common-weale’, and
the patentee, who was possessed of ‘tricks and slights to pass the
seale’, is brought out with especial distinctness. Samuel Butler’s
character<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
of the projector is of less importance, since it was not published
until 1759. The real importance of Jonson’s satire lies in the fact
that it appeared in the midst of the most active discussion on the
subject of monopolies. Drummond says that he was ‘accused upon’ the
play, and that the King ‘desired him to conceal  it’.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Whether the subject which gave offense was the one which we have been
considering or that of witchcraft, it is, however, impossible to determine.</p>

<h5><a name="Sect_C_III_3"></a>3. <i>Witchcraft</i></h5>

<p>Witchcraft in Jonson’s time was not an outworn belief, but a
living issue. It is remarkable that the persecutions which followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[lxiii]</a></span>
upon this terrible delusion were comparatively infrequent during the
Middle Ages, and reached their maximum only in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The first English Act against witchcraft after the Norman Conquest
was passed in 1541 (33 Hen. VIII. c. 8). This Act, which was of a
general nature, and directed against various kinds of sorceries, was
followed by another in 1562 (5 Eliz. c. 16). At the accession of
James I. in 1603 was passed 1 Jac. I. c. 12, which continued law for
more than a century.</p>

<p>During this entire period charges of witchcraft were frequent.
In Scotland they were especially numerous, upwards of fifty being
recorded during the years 1596-7.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
The trial of Anne Turner in 1615, in which charges of witchcraft were
joined with those of poisoning, especially attracted the attention of
Jonson. In 1593 occurred the trial of the ‘three Witches of Warboys’,
in 1606 that of Mary Smith, in 1612 that of the earlier Lancashire
Witches, and of the later in 1633. These are only a few of the
more famous cases. Of no less importance in this connection is the
attitude of the King himself. In the famous <i>Demonology</i><a
name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a
href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> he allied himself
unhesitatingly with the cause of superstition. Witchcraft was of
course not without its opponents, but these were for the most part
obscure men and of little personal influence. While Bacon and Raleigh
were inclining to a belief in witchcraft, and Sir Thomas Browne
was offering his support to persecution, the cause of reason was
intrusted to such champions as Reginald Scot, the author of the
famous <i>Discovery of Witchcraft</i>, 1584, a work which fearlessly
exposes the prevailing follies and crimes. It is on this side that
Jonson places himself. That he should make a categorical statement as
to his belief or disbelief in witchcraft is not to be expected. It is
enough that he presents a picture of the pretended demoniac, that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[lxiv]</a></span>
makes it as sordid and hateful as possible, that he draws for us
in the person of Justice Eitherside the portrait of the bigoted,
unreasonable, and unjust judge, and that he openly ridicules the
series of cases which he used as the source of his witch scenes
(cf. Act. 5. Sc. 3).</p>

<p>To form an adequate conception of the poet’s satirical purpose in
this play one should compare the methods used here with the treatment
followed in Jonson’s other dramas where the witch motive occurs.
In <i>The Masque of Queens</i>, 1609, and in <i>The Sad Shepherd</i>, Jonson
employed the lore of witchcraft more freely, but in a quite different
way. Here, instead of hard realism with all its hideous details,
the more picturesque beliefs and traditions are used for purely
imaginative and poetical purposes.</p>

<p><i>The Masque of Queens</i> was presented at Whitehall, and dedicated
to Prince Henry. Naturally Jonson’s attitude toward witchcraft
would here be respectful. It is to be observed, however, that in
the copious notes which are appended to the masque no contemporary
trials are referred to. The poet relies upon the learned compilations
of Bodin, Remigius, Cornelius Agrippa, and Paracelsus, together
with many of the classical authors. He is clearly dealing with the
mythology of witchcraft. Nightshade and henbane, sulphur, vapors, the
eggshell boat, and the cobweb sail are the properties which he uses
in this poetic drama. The treatment does not differ essentially from
that of Middleton and Shakespeare.</p>

<p>In <i>The Sad Shepherd</i> the purpose is still different. We have
none of the wild unearthliness of the masque. Maudlin is a witch of
a decidedly vulgar type, but there is no satirical intent. Jonson,
for the purpose of his play, accepts for the moment the prevailing
attitude toward witchcraft, and the satisfaction in Maudlin’s
discomfiture doubtless assumed an acquiescence in the popular belief.
At the same time the poetical aspect is not wholly forgotten, and
appears with especial prominence in the beautiful passage which
describes the witch’s forest haunt, beginning: ‘Within a gloomy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[lxv]</a></span>
dimble she doth dwell’. <i>The Sad Shepherd</i> and the masque are far
more akin to each other in their treatment of witchcraft than is
either to <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>.</p>

<h4><a name="Sect_C_IV"></a>IV. <span class="smcap">Personal Satire</span></h4>

<p>The detection of personal satire in Jonson’s drama is difficult,
and at best unsatisfactory. Jonson himself always resented it as an
impertinence.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
In the present case Fleay suggests that the motto, <i>Ficta, voluptatis
causa, sint proxima veris</i>, is an indication that we are to look upon
the characters as real persons. But Jonson twice took the pains to
explain that this is precisely the opposite of his own interpretation
of Horace’s meaning.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
The subject of personal satire was a favorite one with him, and in
<i>The Magnetic Lady</i> he makes the sufficiently explicit statement: ‘A
play, though it apparel and present vices in general, flies from all
particularities in persons’.</p>

<p>On the other hand we know that Jonson did occasionally indulge in
personal satire. Carlo Buffone,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
Antonio Balladino,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and the clerk Nathaniel<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
are instances sufficiently authenticated. Of these Jonson advances a
plea of justification: ‘Where have I been particular? where personal?
except to a mimic, cheater, bawd or buffoon, creatures, for their
insolencies, worthy to be taxed? yet to which of these so pointingly,
as he might not either ingenuously have confest, or wisely dissembled
his disease?’<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>In only one play do we know that the principal characters
represent real people. But between <i>Poetaster</i> and <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[lxvi]</a></span>
there is a vast difference of treatment. In <i>Poetaster</i> (1) the
attitude is undisguisedly satirical. The allusions in the prologues
and notices to the reader are direct and unmistakable. (2) The
character-drawing is partly caricature, partly allegorical. This
method is easily distinguishable from the typical, which aims to
satirize a class. (3) Jonson does not draw upon historical events,
but personal idiosyncrasies. (4) The chief motive is in the spirit
of Aristophanes, the great master of personal satire. These methods
are what we should naturally expect in a composition of this sort. Of
such internal evidence we find little or nothing in <i>The Devil is an
Ass</i>. Several plausible identifications, however, have been proposed,
and these we must consider separately.</p>

<p>The chief characters are identified by Fleay as follows: Wittipol
is Jonson. He has returned from travel, and had seen Mrs. Fitzdottrel
before he went. Mrs. Fitzdottrel is the Lady Elizabeth Hatton.
Fitzdottrel is her husband, Sir Edward Coke.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_C_IV_1"></a><b>Mrs. Fitzdottrel</b>.&emsp;The identification is
based upon a series of correspondences between a passage in <i>The Devil is an
Ass</i> (2. 6. 57-113) and a number of passages scattered through
Jonson’s works. The most important of these are quoted in the note
to the above passage. To them has been added an important passage
from <i>A Challenge at Tilt</i>, 1613. Fleay’s deductions are these: (1)
<i>Underwoods 36</i> and <i>Charis</i> must be addressed to the same lady
(cf. especially <i>Ch.</i>, part 5). (2) Charis and Mrs. Fitzdottrel
are identical. The song (2. 6. 94 f.) is found complete in the
<i>Celebration of Charis</i>. In Wittipol’s preceding speech we find
the phrases ‘milk and roses’ and ‘bank of kisses’, which occur in
<i>Charis</i> and in <i>U. 36</i>, and a reference to the husband who is the
‘just excuse’ for the wife’s infidelity, which occurs in <i>U. 36</i>. (3)
Charis is Lady Hatton. Fleay believes that <i>Charis</i>, part 1, in which
the poet speaks of himself as writing ‘fifty years’, was written c
1622-3; but that parts 2-10 were written c 1608. In reference to
these parts he says: ‘Written in reference to a mask in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[lxvii]</a></span>
Charis represented Venus riding in a chariot drawn by swans and
doves (<i>Charis</i>, part 4), at a marriage, and leading the Graces in a
dance at Whitehall, worthy to be envied of the Queen (6), in which
Cupid had a part (2, 3, 5), at which Charis kissed him (6, 7), and
afterwards kept up a close intimacy with him (8, 9, 10). The mask
of 1608, Feb. 9, exactly fulfils these conditions, and the Venus of
that mask was probably L. Elizabeth Hatton, the most beautiful of
the then court ladies. She had appeared in the mask of Beauty, 1608,
Jan. 10, but in no other year traceable by me. From the Elegy, G. 36,
manifestly written to the same lady (compare it with the lines in
5 as to “the bank of kisses” and “the bath of milk and roses”), we
learn that Charis had “a husband that is the just excuse of all that
can be done him”. This was her second husband, Sir Edward Coke, to
whom she was married in 1593’.</p>

<p>Fleay’s theory rests chiefly upon (1) his interpretation of
<i>The Celebration of Claris</i>; (2) the identity of Charis and Mrs.
Fitzdottrel. A study of the poem has led me to conclusions of a
very different nature from those of Fleay. They may be stated as follows:</p>

<p><i>Charis</i> 1. This was evidently written in 1622-3. Jonson plainly
says: ‘Though I now write fifty years’. Charis is here seemingly
identified with Lady Purbeck, daughter of Lady Hatton. Compare the
last two lines with the passage from <i>The Gipsies</i>. Fleay believes
the compliments were transferred in the masque at Lady Hatton’s
request.</p>

<p><i>Charis</i> 4 and 7 have every mark of being insertions. (1) They
are in different metres from each other and from the other sections,
which in this respect are uniform. (2) They are not in harmony with
the rest of the poem. They entirely lack the easy, familiar, half
jocular style which characterizes the eight other parts. (3) Each
is a somewhat ambitious effort, complete in itself, and distinctly
lyrical. (4) In neither is there any mention of or reference to
Charis. (5) It is evident, therefore, that they were not written for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[lxviii]</a></span>
the <i>Charis</i> poem, but merely interpolated. They are, then, of all
the parts the least valuable for the purpose of identification,
nor are we justified in looking upon them as continuing a definite
narrative with the rest of the poem. (6) The evident reason for
introducing them is their own intrinsic lyrical merit.</p>

<p><i>Charis</i> 4 was apparently written in praise of some pageant,
probably a court masque. The representation of Venus drawn in a
chariot by swans and doves, the birds sacred to her, may have been
common enough. That this is an accurate description of the masque of
February 9, 1608 is, however, a striking fact, and it is possible
that the lady referred to is the same who represented Venus in that
masque. But (1) we do not even know that Jonson refers to a masque of
his own, or a masque at all. (2) We have no trustworthy evidence that
Lady Hatton was the Venus of that masque. Fleay’s identification is
little better than a guess. (3) Evidence is derived from the first
stanza alone. This does not appear in <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>, and
probably was not written at the time. Otherwise there is no reason
for its omission in that place. It seems to have been added for the
purpose of connecting the lyric interpolation with the rest of the poem.</p>

<p><i>Charis</i> 5 seems to be a late production. (1) Jonson combines
in this single section a large number of figures used in other
places. (2) That it was not the origin of these figures seems to be
intimated by the words of the poem. Cupid is talking. He had lately
found Jonson describing his lady, and Jonson’s words, he says, are
descriptive of Cupid’s own mother, Venus. So Homer had spoken of her
hair, so Anacreon of her face. He continues:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By her looks I do her know</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Which you call</i> my shafts.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The italicized words may refer to <i>U. 36.</i> 3-4. They correspond,
however, much more closely to <i>Challenge</i>, <i>2 Cup.</i> The ‘bath your
verse discloses’ (l. 21) may refer to <i>DA.</i> 2. 6. 82-3.
<i>U. 36.</i> 7-8 or <i>Gipsies</i> 15-6.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[lxix]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">... the bank of kisses,</span>
<span class="i0">Where <i>you say</i> men gather blisses</span>
</div></div>

<p>is mentioned in <i>U. 36.</i> 9-10. ‘The passages in <i>DA.</i> and
<i>Gipsies</i><a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
are less close. The ‘valley <i>called</i> my nest’ may be a reference to
<i>DA.</i> 2. 6. 74 f. Jonson had already spoken of the ‘girdle ’bout her
waist’ in <i>Challenge</i>, <i>2 Cup.</i> <i>Charis</i> 5 seems then to have been
written later than <i>U. 36</i>, <i>Challenge</i>, 1613, and probably <i>Devil is
an Ass</i>, 1616. The evidence is strong, though not conclusive.</p>

<p><i>Charis</i> 6 evidently refers to a marriage at Whitehall. That
Cupid, who is referred to in 2, 3, 5, had any part in the marriage of
<i>Charis</i> 6 is nowhere even intimated. That Charis led the Graces in a
dance is a conjecture equally unfounded. Jonson of course takes the
obvious opportunity (ll. 20, 26) of playing on the name Charis. That
this occasion was the same as that celebrated in 4 we have no reason
to believe. It applies equally well, for instance, to <i>A Challenge
at Tilt</i>, but we are by no means justified in so limiting it. It may
have been imaginary.</p>

<p><i>Charis</i> 7 was written before 1618, since Jonson quoted a part
of it to Drummond during his visit in Scotland (cf. <i>Conversations</i>
5). It was a favorite of the poet’s and this furnishes sufficient
reason for its insertion here. It is worthy of note that the two
sections of <i>Charis</i>, which we know by external proof to have been
in existence before 1623, are those which give internal evidence of
being interpolations.</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i> The poem was probably a late production and of
composite nature. There is no reason for supposing that the greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">[lxx]</a></span>
part was not written in 1622-3. The fourth and seventh parts are
interpolations. The first stanza of the fourth part, upon which the
identification largely rests, seems not to have been written until
the poem was put together in 1622-3. If it was written at the same
time as the other two stanzas, we cannot expect to find it forming
part of a connected narrative. The events described in the fourth and
sixth parts are not necessarily the same. There is practically no
evidence that Lady Hatton was the Venus of 1608, or that <i>Charis</i>
is addressed to any particular lady.</p>

<p>The other link in Fleay’s chain of evidence is of still weaker
substance. The mere repetition of compliments does not necessarily
prove the recipient to be the same person. In fact we find in these
very pieces the same phrases applied indiscriminately to Lady
Purbeck, Lady Frances Howard, Mrs. Fitzdottrel, perhaps to Lady
Hatton, and even to the Earl of Somerset. Of what value, then, can
such evidence be?</p>

<p>Fleay’s whole theory rests on this poem, and biographical evidence
is unnecessary. It is sufficient to notice that Lady Hatton was
a proud woman, that marriage with so eminent a man as Sir Edward
Coke was considered a great condescension (<i>Chamberlain’s Letters</i>,
Camden Soc., p. 29), and that an amour with Jonson is extremely
improbable.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_C_IV_2"></a><b>Fitzdottrel.</b>&emsp;Fleay’s identification of
Fitzdottrel with Coke rests chiefly on the fact that Coke was Lady Hatton’s
husband. The following considerations are added. Fitzdottrel is a ‘squire of
Norfolk’. Sir E. Coke was a native of Norfolk, and had held office
in Norwich. Fitzdottrel’s rôle as sham demoniac is a covert allusion
to Coke’s adoption of the popular witch doctrines in the Overbury
trial. His jealousy of his wife was shown in the same trial, where
he refused to read the document of ‘what ladies loved what lords’,
because, as was popularly supposed, his own wife’s name headed the
list. Jonson is taking advantage of Coke’s disgrace in
November, 1616. He had flattered him in 1613 (<i>U. 64</i>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[lxxi]</a></span></p>

<p>Our reasons for rejecting this theory are as follows: (1) The
natural inference is that Jonson would not deliberately attack
the man whom he had highly praised three years before. I do not
understand Fleay’s assertion that Jonson was always ready to attack
the fallen. (2) The compliment paid to Coke in 1613 (<i>U. 64</i>)
was not the flattery of an hour of triumph. The appointment to the
king’s bench was displeasing to Coke, and made at the suggestion
of Bacon with the object of removing him to a place where he would
come less often into contact with the king. (3) Fitzdottrel is a
light-headed man of fashion, who spends his time in frequenting
theatres and public places, and in conjuring evil spirits. Coke was
sixty-four years old, the greatest lawyer of his time, and a man of
the highest gifts and attainments. (4) The attempted parallel between
Fitzdottrel, the pretended demoniac, and Coke, as judge in the
Overbury trial, is patently absurd. (5) If Lady Hatton had not been
selected for identification with Mrs. Fitzdottrel, Coke would never
have been dreamed of as a possible Fitzdottrel.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_C_IV_3"></a><b>Wittipol.</b>&emsp;He is a young man just returned
from travel, which apparently has been of considerable duration. He saw Mrs.
Fitzdottrel once before he went, and upon returning immediately seeks
her out. How does this correspond to Jonson’s life? <i>The Hue and Cry</i>
was played February 9, 1608. According to Fleay’s interpretation,
this was followed by an intimacy with Lady Hatton. Five years later,
in 1613, Drummond tells us that Jonson went to France with the son
of Sir Walter Raleigh. He returned the same year in time to compose
<i>A Challenge at Tilt</i>, December 27. Three years later he wrote <i>The
Devil is an Ass</i> at the age of forty-three.</p>

<p>Wittipol intimates that he is Mrs. Fitzdottrel’s equal in years,
in fashion (1. 6. 124-5), and in blood (1. 6. 168). For Jonson to say
this to Lady Hatton would have been preposterous.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_C_IV_4"></a><b>Justice Eitherside.</b>&emsp;Only the desire to
prove a theory at all costs could have prevented Fleay from seeing that

lxxii]</a></span> Coke’s counterpart is not Fitzdottrel, but Justice
Eitherside. In obstinacy, bigotry, and vanity this character
represents the class of judges with which Coke identified himself
in the Overbury trial. Nor are these merely class-traits. They
are distinctly the faults which marred Coke’s career from the
beginning. It is certain that Coke is partially responsible for this
portraiture. Overbury was a personal friend of the poet, and the
trial, begun in the previous year, had extended into 1616. Jonson
must have followed it eagerly. On the other hand, it is improbable
that the picture was aimed exclusively at Coke. He merely furnished
traits for a typical and not uncommon character. As we have seen, it
is in line with Jonson’s usual practise to confine personal satire to
the lesser characters.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_C_IV_5"></a><b>Merecraft.</b>&emsp;Fleay’s identification with
Sir Giles Mompesson has very little to commend it. Mompesson was connected by
marriage with James I.’s powerful favorite, George Villiers, later
Duke of Buckingham. In 1616 he suggested to Villiers the creation of
a special commission for the purpose of granting licenses to keepers
of inns and ale-houses. The suggestion was adopted by Villiers;
Mompesson was appointed to the Commission in October, 1616, and
knighted on November 18 of that year. The patent was not sealed until
March, 1617. His high-handed conduct soon became unpopular, but he
continued in favor with Villiers and James, and his disgrace did not
come until 1621.</p>

<p>It will readily be seen that Mompesson’s position and career
conform in no particular to those of Merecraft in the present play.
Mompesson was a knight, a friend of the king’s favorite, and in favor
with the king. Merecraft is a mere needy adventurer without influence
at court, and the associate of ruffians, who frequent the ‘Straits’
and the ‘Bermudas’. Mompesson was himself the recipient of a patent
(see section III. 2). Merecraft is merely the projector who devises
clever projects for more powerful patrons. Mompesson’s project bears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">[lxxiii]</a></span>
no resemblance to those suggested by Merecraft, and he could hardly
have attracted any popular dislike at the time when <i>The Devil is
an Ass</i> was presented, since, as we have seen, his patent was not
even sealed until the following year. Finally, Jonson would hardly
have attacked a man who stood so high at court as did Mompesson in 1616.</p>

<p>It is evident that Jonson had particularly in mind those
projectors whose object it was to drain the fens of Lincolnshire. The
attempts, as we have seen, were numerous, and it is highly improbable
that Jonson wished to satirize any one of them more severely than
another. In a single passage, however, it seems possible that Sir
John Popham (see page lx) is referred to. In Act 4. Sc. 1 Merecraft
speaks of a Sir John Monie-man as a projector who was able to ‘jump
a business quickly’ because ‘he had great friends’. That Popham is
referred to seems not unlikely from the fact that he was the most
important personage who had embarked upon an enterprise of this sort,
that his scheme was one of the earliest, that he was not a strict
contemporary (d. 1607), and that his scheme had been very unpopular.
This is proved by an anonymous letter to the king, in which complaint
is made that ‘the “covetous bloody Popham” will ruin many poor men
by his offer to drain the fens’ (<i>Cal. State Papers</i>, Mar. 14?, 1606).</p>

<p><a name="Sect_C_IV_6"></a><b>Plutarchus Guilthead.</b>&emsp;Fleay’s identification
with Edmund Howes I am prepared to accept, although biographical data are
very meagre. Fleay says: ‘Plutarchus Gilthead, who is writing the
lives of the great men in the city; the captain who writes of the
Artillery Garden “to train the youth”, etc. [3. 2. 45], is, I think,
Edmond Howes, whose continuation of Stow’s Chronicle was published in 1615.’</p>

<p>Howes’ undertaking was a matter of considerable ridicule to his
acquaintances. In his 1631 edition he speaks of the heavy blows and
great discouragements he received from his friends. He was in the
habit of signing himself ‘Gentleman’ and this seems to be satirized
in 3. 1, where Guilthead says repeatedly: ‘This is to make you a
Gentleman’ (see <i>N. &amp; Q.</i> 1st Ser. 6. 199.).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">[lxxiv]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Sect_C_IV_7"></a><b>The Noble House.</b> Two proposed identifications
of the ‘noble house’, which pretends to a duke’s title, mentioned at 2. 4. 15-6.
have been made. The expenditure of much energy in the attempt to
fix so veiled an allusion is hardly worth while. Jonson of course
depended upon contemporary rumor, for which we have no data.</p>

<p>Cunningham’s suggestion that Buckingham is referred to is not
convincing. Buckingham’s father was Sir George Villiers of Brooksby
in Leicestershire. He was not himself raised to the nobility until
August 27, 1616, when he was created Viscount Villiers and Baron
Waddon. It was not until January 5, 1617 (not 1616, as Cunningham
says), that he became Earl of Buckingham, and it is unlikely that
before this time any allusion to Villiers’ aspiration to a dukedom
would have been intelligible to Jonson’s audience.</p>

<p>Fleay’s theory that the ‘noble house’ was that of Stuart may be
accepted provisionally. Lodowick was made Earl of Richmond in 1613,
and Duke in 1623. He was acceptable to king and people, and in this
very year was made steward of the household.</p>

<h3><a name="Sect_D"></a>D. AFTER-INFLUENCE OF THE DEVIL IS AN ASS</h3>

<p>A few instances of the subsequent rehandling of certain motives
in this play are too striking to be completely overlooked. John
Wilson, 1627-c 1696, a faithful student and close imitator of Jonson,
produced in 1690 a drama called <i>Belphegor</i>, or <i>The Marriage of
the Devil, a Tragi-comedy</i>. While it is founded on the English
translation of Machiavelli’s novella, which appeared in 1674, and
closely adheres to the lines of the original, it shows clear evidence
of Jonson’s influence. The subject has been fully investigated by
Hollstein (cf. <i>Verhältnis</i>, pp. 22-24, 28-30, 35, 43, 50).</p>

<p><i>The Cheats</i>, 1662, apparently refers to <i>The Devil is an Ass</i> in
the <i>Prologue</i>. The characters of Bilboe and Titere Tu belong to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">[lxxv]</a></span>
same class of low bullies as Merecraft and Everill, but the
evident prototypes of these characters are Subtle and Face in
<i>The Alchemist</i>.</p>

<p>A third play of Wilson’s, <i>The Projectors</i>, 1664, shows
unmistakable influence of <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>. The chief object
of satire is of course the same, and the character of Sir Gudgeon
Credulous is modeled after that of Fitzdottrel. The scenes in which
the projects are explained, 2. 1 and 3. 1, are similar to the
corresponding passages in Jonson. The <i>Aulularia</i> of Plautus is a
partial source, so that the play in some features resembles <i>The Case
is Altered</i>. In 2. 1 Wilson imitates the passage in the <i>Aulularia</i>,
which closes Act 2. Sc. 1 of <i>The Devil is an Ass</i> (see note <a href="#Note_2_1_168">2. 1. 168</a>).</p>

<p>Brome, Jonson’s old servant and friend, also handled the subject
of monopolies (<a href="#Page_lxi">see page lxi</a>). Jonson’s influence is especially
marked in <i>The Court Beggar</i>. The project of perukes (<i>Wks.</i> 1. 192)
should be compared with Merecraft’s project of toothpicks.</p>

<p>Mrs. Susanna Centlivre’s <i>Busie Body</i> uses the motives borrowed
from Boccaccio (see pp. <a href="#Page_xlv">xlv ff</a>.). The scenes in which
these appear must have been suggested by Jonson’s play (Genest 2. 419), though
the author seems to have been acquainted with the <i>Decameron</i> also.
In Act. 1. Sc. 1 Sir George Airy makes a bargain with Sir Francis
Gripe similar to Wittipol’s bargain with Fitzdottrel. In exchange for
the sum of a hundred guineas he is admitted into the house for the
purpose of moving his suit to Miranda. ‘for the space of ten minutes,
without lett or molestation’, provided Sir Francis remain in the same
room, though out of ear shot (2d ed., p. 8). In Act 2. Sc. 1 the
bargain is carried out in much the same way as in Boccaccio and in
Jonson. Miranda remaining dumb and Sir George answering for her.</p>

<p>In Act 3. Sc. 4 (2d ed., p. 38) Miranda in the presence of her
guardian sends a message by Marplot not to saunter at the garden gate
about eight o’clock as he has been accustomed to do, thus making an
assignation with him (compare <i>DA.</i> 2. 2. 52).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">[lxxvi]</a></span></p>

<p>Other motives which seem to show some influence of <i>The Devil is
an Ass</i> are Miranda’s trick to have the estate settled upon her,
Charles’ disguise as a Spaniard, and Traffick’s jealous care of
Isabinda. The character of Marplot as comic butt resembles that of Pug.</p>

<p>The song in <i>The Devil is an Ass</i> 2. 6. 94 (<a href="#Line_2_6_94">see note</a>)
was imitated by Sir John Suckling.</p>

<h4><a name="Sect_D_1"></a>APPENDIX&emsp;<span class="smcap">Extracts from the Critics</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Gifford</span>: There is much good writing
in this comedy. All the speeches of Satan are replete with the most
biting satire, delivered with an appropriate degree of spirit.
Fitzdottrel is one of those characters which Jonson delighted
to draw, and in which he stood unrivalled, a <i>gull</i>, i. e., a
confident coxcomb, selfish, cunning, and conceited. Mrs. Fitzdottrel
possesses somewhat more interest than the generality of our author’s
females, and is indeed a well sustained character. In action the
principal amusement of the scene (exclusive of the admirable
burlesque of witchery in the conclusion) was probably derived from
the mortification of poor Pug, whose stupid stare of amazement at
finding himself made an <i>ass</i> of on every possible occasion must,
if portrayed as some then on the stage were well able to portray it,
have been exquisitely comic.</p>

<p>This play is strictly moral in its conception and conduct. Knavery
and folly are shamed and corrected, virtue is strengthened and
rewarded, and the ends of dramatic justice are sufficiently answered
by the simple exposure of those whose errors are merely subservient
to the minor interests of the piece.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herford</span> (<i>Studies in the Literary
Relations of England and Germany</i>, pp. 318-20): Jonson had in fact
so far the Aristophanic quality of genius, that he was at once a most
elaborate and minute student of the actual world, and a poet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvii" id="Page_lxxvii">[lxxvii]</a></span>
of the airiest and boldest fancy, and that he loved to bring the two
rôles into the closest possible combination. No one so capable of
holding up the mirror to contemporary society without distorting the
slenderest thread of its complex tissue of usages; no one, on the
other hand, who so keenly delighted in startling away the illusion or
carefully undermining it by some palpably fantastic invention. His
most elaborate reproductions of the everyday world are hardly ever
without an infusion of equally elaborate caprice,&mdash;a leaven of
recondite and fantastic legend and grotesque myth, redolent of old
libraries and antique scholarship, furtively planted, as it were,
in the heart of that everyday world of London life, and so subtly
blending with it that the whole motley throng of merchants and
apprentices, gulls and gallants, discover nothing unusual in it, and
engage with the most perfectly matter of fact air in the business
of working it out. The purging of Crispinus in the <i>Poetaster</i>,
the Aristophanic motive of the <i>Magnetic Lady</i>, even the farcical
horror of noise which is the mainspring of the <i>Epicœne</i>, are only
less elaborate and sustained examples of this fantastic realism than
the adventure of a Stupid Devil in the play before us. Nothing more
anomalous in the London of Jonson’s day could be conceived; yet
it is so managed that it loses all its strangeness. So perfectly
is the supernatural element welded with the human, that it almost
ceases to appear supernatural. Pug, the hero of the adventure, is a
pretty, petulant boy, more human by many degrees than the half fairy
Puck of Shakespeare, which doubtless helped to suggest him, and the
arch-fiend Satan is a bluff old politician, anxious to ward off the
perils of London from his young simpleton of a son, who is equally
eager to plunge into them. The old savage horror fades away before
Jonson’s humanising touch, the infernal world loses all its privilege
of peculiar terror and strength, and sinks to the footing of a mere
rival state, whose merchandise can be kept out of the market and its
citizens put in the Counter or carted to Tyburn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">[lxxviii]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. W. Ward</span> (<i>Eng. Dram. Lit.</i>, pp.
372-3): The oddly-named comedy of <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>, acted in
1616, seems already to exhibit a certain degree of decay in the
dramatic powers which had so signally called forth its predecessor.
Yet this comedy possesses a considerable literary interest, as
adapting both to Jonson’s dramatic method, and to the general moral
atmosphere of his age, a theme connecting itself with some of the
most notable creations of the earlier Elizabethan drama.... The idea
of the play is as healthy as its plot is ingenious; but apart from
the circumstance that the latter is rather slow in preparation, and
by no means, I think, gains in perspicuousness as it proceeds, the
design itself suffers from one radical mistake. Pug’s intelligence
is so much below par that he suffers as largely on account of
his clumsiness as on account of his viciousness, while remaining
absolutely without influence upon the course of the action. The
comedy is at the same time full of humor, particularly in the entire
character of Fitzdottrel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swinburne</span> (<i>Study of Ben Jonson</i>, pp.
65-7): If <i>The Devil is an Ass</i> cannot be ranked among the crowning
masterpieces of its author, it is not because the play shows any sign
of decadence in literary power or in humorous invention. The writing
is admirable, the wealth of comic matter is only too copious, the
characters are as firm in outline or as rich in color as any but the
most triumphant examples of his satirical or sympathetic skill in
finished delineation and demarcation of humors. On the other hand, it
is of all Ben Jonson’s comedies since the date of <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i>
the most obsolete in subject of satire, the most temporary in its
allusions and applications: the want of fusion or even connection
(except of the most mechanical or casual kind) between the various
parts of its structure and the alternate topics of its ridicule
makes the action more difficult to follow than that of many more
complicated plots: and, finally, the admixture of serious sentiment
and noble emotion is not so skilfully managed as to evade the
imputation of incongruity. [The dialogue between Lady Tailbush
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix">[lxxix]</a></span>
and Lady Eitherside in Act 4. Sc. 1 has some touches ‘worthy
of Molière himself.’ In Act 4. Sc. 3 Mrs. Fitzdottrel’s speech
possesses a ‘a noble and natural eloquence,’ but the character of
her husband is ‘almost too loathsome to be ridiculous,’ and unfit
‘for the leading part in a comedy of ethics as well as of morals.’]
The prodigality of elaboration lavished on such a multitude of
subordinate characters, at the expense of all continuous interest and
to the sacrifice of all dramatic harmony, may tempt the reader to
apostrophize the poet in his own words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You are so covetous still to embrace</span>
<span class="i0">More than you can, that you lose all.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet a word of parting praise must be given to Satan: a small
part as far as extent goes, but a splendid example of high comic
imagination after the order of Aristophanes, admirably relieved by
the low comedy of the asinine Pug and the voluble doggrel by the
antiquated Vice.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>The present edition includes whatever has been considered of value
in the notes of preceding editions. It has been the intention in
all cases to acknowledge facts and suggestions borrowed from such
sources, whether quoted verbatim, abridged, or developed. Notes
signed W. are from Whalley, G. from Gifford, C. from Cunningham.
For other abbreviations the Bibliography should be consulted.
Explanations of words and phrases are usually found only in the
Glossary. References to this play are by act, scene, and line of the
Text; other plays of Jonson are cited from the Gifford-Cunningham
edition of 1875. The references are to play, volume and page.</p>

<h3>TITLE-PAGE.</h3>

<p><b>THE DIUELL IS AN ASSE.</b> ‘Schlegel, seizing with great
felicity upon an untranslateable German idiom, called the play <i>Der
dumme Teufel</i> [Schlegel’s <i>Werke</i>, ed. Böcking, 6. 340]&mdash;a
title which must be allowed to be twice as good as that of the English
original. The phrase ‘the Devil is an ass’ appears to have been
proverbial. See Fletcher’s <i>The Chances</i>, Act 5. Sc. 2:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">Dost thou think</span>
<span class="i0">The devil such an ass as people make him?’</span>
<span class="i27">&mdash;Ward, <i>Eng. Drama</i> 2. 372.</span>
</div></div>

<p>A still more important passage occurs in Dekker’s <i>If this be not a
good Play</i>, a partial source of Jonson’s drama:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Scu.</i> Sweete-breads I hold my life, that diuels an asse.</span>
<span class="i32">&mdash;Dekker, <i>Wks.</i> 3. 328.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Jonson uses it again in <i>The Staple of News</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 5. 188:</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;The conjurer cozened him with a candle’s end; he was an ass.</p>

<p>Dekker (<i>Non-dram. Wks.</i> 2. 275) tells us the jest of a citizen
who was told that the ‘Lawyers get the Diuell and all: What an
Asse, replied the Citizen is the diuell? If I were as he I would
get some of them.’</p>

<p><b>HIS MAIESTIES SERVANTS.</b> Otherwise known as the
<i>King’s Company</i>, and popularly spoken of as the <i>King’s Men</i>. For
an account of this company see Winter, ed. <i>Staple of News</i>, p. 121;
and Fleay, <i>Biog. Chron.</i> 1. 356-7; 2. 403-4.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Ficta voluptatis</b>, etc. The quotation is from Horace,
<i>De Art. Poet.</i>, line 338. Jonson’s translation is:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let what thou feign’st for pleasure’s sake, be near</span>
<span class="i0">The truth.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Jonson makes use of this quotation again in his note ‘To the
Reader’ prefixed to Act 3 of <i>The Staple of News</i>.</p>

<p>I. B. Fleay speaks of this printer as J. Benson (<i>Biog. Chron</i>.
1. 354). Benson did not ‘take up freedom’ until June 30, 1631 (<i>Sta.
Reg.</i> 3. 686). Later he became a publisher (1635-40; <i>Sta. Reg.</i>
5. lxxxiv). I. B. was also the printer of <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> and <i>Staple
of News</i>. J. Benson published a volume of Jonson’s, containing <i>The
Masque of the Gypsies</i> and other poems, in 1640 (<i>Brit. Museum Cat.</i>
and Yale Library). In the same year he printed the <i>Art of Poetry</i>,
12mo, and the <i>Execration against Vulcan</i>, 4to (cf. <i>Pub. of Grolier
Club</i>, N. Y. 1893, pp. 130, 132). The evidence that I. B. was Benson
is strong, but not absolutely conclusive.</p>

<p><b>ROBERT ALLOT.</b> We find by Arber’s reprint of the
<i>Stationer’s Register</i> that Robert Allot ‘took up freedom’ Nov. 7,
1625. He must have begun publishing shortly after, for under the date
of Jan. 25, 1625-6 we find that Mistris Hodgettes ‘assigned over unto
him all her estate,’ consisting of the copies of certain books, for
the ‘some of forty-five pounds.’ The first entry of a book to Allot
is made May 7, 1626. In 1630 Master Blount ‘assigned over unto him
all his estate and right in the copies’ of sixteen of Shakespeare’s
plays. In 1632 Allot brought out the Second Folio of Shakespeare’s
works. On Sept. 7, 1631 <i>The Staple of News</i> was assigned to him.
The last entry of a book in his name is on Sept. 12, 1635. The first
mention of ‘Mistris Allott’ is under the date of Dec. 30, 1635. Under
date of July 1, 1637 is the record of the assignment by Mistris
Allott of certain books, formerly the estate of ‘Master Roberte
Allotts deceased.’ Among these books are ‘37. <i>Shakespeares Workes</i>
their part. 39. <i>Staple of Newes</i> a Play. 40. <i>Bartholomew fayre</i>
a Play.’ I have been able to find no record of <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>
in the <i>Stationer’s Register</i>.</p>

<p><b>the Beare.</b> In the Shakespeare folio of 1632 Allot’s sign reads
‘the Black Beare.’ The first mention of the shop in the <i>London
Street Directory</i> is in 1575, among the ‘Houses round the Churchyard.’</p>

<p><b>Pauls Church-yard.</b> ‘Before the Fire, which destroyed the old
Cathedral, St. Paul’s Churchyard was chiefly inhabited by stationers,
whose shops were then, and until the year 1760, distinguished by
signs.’&mdash;Wh-C.</p>

<h3>THE PERSONS OF THE PLAY.</h3>

<p><b>GVILT-HEAD, A Gold-smith.</b> The goldsmiths seem to have been
a prosperous guild. (See Stow, <i>Survey</i>, ed. Thoms, p. 114.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
At this time they performed the office of banking, constituting
the intermediate stage between the usurer and the modern banker.
‘The goldsmiths began to borrow at interest in order to lend out to
traders at a higher rate. In other words they became the connecting
link between those who had money to lend and those who wished to
borrow for trading purposes, or it might be to improve their estates.
No doubt at first the goldsmiths merely acted as guardians of their
clients’ hoards, but they soon began to utilize those hoards much as
bankers now make use of the money deposited with them.’&mdash;<i>Social England</i> 3. 544.</p>

<p><b>AMBLER.</b> Jonson uses this name again in <i>Neptune’s Triumph</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 8. 32:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Grave master Ambler, news-master o’ Paul’s,</span>
<span class="i0">Supplies your capon.</span>
</div></div>

<p>It reappears in <i>The Staple of News</i>.</p>

<p><b>Her Gentlemanvsher.</b> For an exposition of the character and
duties of the gentleman-usher see the notes to 4. 4. 134. 201, 215.</p>

<p><b>Newgate.</b> ‘This gate hath of long time been a gaol, or prison
for felons and trespassers, as appeareth by records in the reign of
King John, and of other kings.’&mdash;Stow, <i>Survey</i>, ed. Thoms, p. 14.</p>

<h3>THE PROLOGUE.</h3>

<p><b>1 The DIVELL is an Asse.</b> ‘This is said by the prologue
pointing to the <i>title</i> of the play, which as was then the custom,
was painted in large letters and placed in some conspicuous part of
the stage.’&mdash;G.</p>

<p>Cf. <i>Poetaster</i>, <i>After the second sounding</i>: ‘What’s here? THE
ARRAIGNMENT!’ Also <i>Wily Beguiled</i>: <i>Prol.</i> How now, my honest rogue?
What play shall we have here to-night?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5"><i>Player.</i> Sir, you may look upon the title.</span>
<span class="i5"><i>Prol.</i>&nbsp;  What, <i>Spectrum</i> once again?’</span>
</div></div>

<p>Jonson often, but not invariably, announces the title of the
play in the prologue or induction. Cf. <i>Every Man out</i>, <i>Cynthia’s
Revels</i>, <i>Poetaster</i>, and all plays subsequent to <i>Bart. Fair</i>
except <i>Sad Shep</i>.</p>

<p><b>3 Grandee’s.</b> Jonson uses this affected form of address
again in <i>Timber</i>, ed. Schelling. 22. 27</p>

<p><b>4 allowing vs no place.</b> As Gifford points out, the prologue
is a protest against the habit prevalent at the time of crowding the
stage with stools for the accommodation of the spectators.</p>

<p>Dekker in Chapter 6 of <i>The Guls Horne-booke</i> gives the gallant
full instructions as to the behavior proper to the play-house.
The youth is advised to wait until ‘the quaking prologue hath (by
rubbing) got culor into his cheekes’, and then ‘to creepe from behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the Arras,’ and plant himself ‘on the very Rushes where the Commedy
is to daunce, yea, and vnder the state of Cambises himselfe.’ Sir
John Davies makes a similar allusion <i>(Epigrams</i>, ed. Grosart, 2.
10). Jonson makes frequent reference to the subject. Cf. <i>Induction</i>
to <i>The Staple of News</i>, <i>Every Man out</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 31;
<i>Prologue</i> to <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 210, etc.</p>

<p><b>5 a subtill thing.</b> I. e., thin, airy, spiritual, and so not
occupying space.</p>

<p><b>6 worne in a thumbe-ring.</b> ‘Nothing was more common,
as we learn from Lilly, than to carry about familiar spirits,
shut up in rings, watches, sword-hilts, and other articles of
dress.’&mdash;G.</p>

<p>I have been unable to verify Gifford’s statement from Lilly, but
the following passage from Harsnet’s <i>Declaration</i> (p. 13) confirms
it: ‘For compassing of this treasure, there was a consociation
betweene 3 or 4 priests, <i>deuill-coniurers</i>, and 4 <i>discouerers</i>,
or <i>seers</i>, reputed to carry about with them, their familiars in rings,
and glasses, by whose suggestion they came to notice of those golden hoards.’</p>

<p>Gifford says that thumb-rings of Jonson’s day were set with jewels
of an extraordinary size, and that they appear to have been ‘more
affected by magistrates and grave citizens than necromancers.’
Cf. <i>I Henry IV</i> 2. 4: ‘I could have crept into any alderman’s
thumb-ring.’ Also <i>Witts Recreat.</i>, <i>Epig.</i> 623:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">He wears a hoop-ring on his thumb; he has</span>
<span class="i5">Of gravidad a dose, full in the face.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Glapthorne, <i>Wit in a Constable</i>, 1639, 4. 1: ‘An alderman&mdash;I
may say to you, he has no more wit than the rest of the bench, and
that lies in his thumb-ring.’</p>

<p><b>8 In compasse of a cheese-trencher.</b> The figure seems
forced to us, but it should be remembered that trenchers were a very
important article of table equipment in Jonson’s day. They were
often embellished with ‘posies,’ and it is possible that Jonson was
thinking of the brevity of such inscriptions. Cf. Dekker, <i>North-Ward
Hoe</i> 3. 1 (<i>Wks.</i> 3. 38): ‘Ile have you make 12. poesies for a
dozen of cheese trenchers.’ Also <i>Honest Whore</i>, Part I, Sc. 13; and
Middleton, <i>Old Law</i> 2. 1 (<i>Wks.</i> 2. 149); <i>No Wit, no Help
like a Woman’s</i> 2. 1 (<i>Wks.</i> 4. 322).</p>

<p><b>15 Like the young adders.</b> It is said that young adders,
when frightened, run into their mother’s mouth for protection.</p>

<p><b>16 Would wee could stand due North.</b> I. e., be as infallible
as the compass.</p>

<p><b>17 Muscouy glasse.</b> Cf. Marston, <i>Malcontent</i>, <i>Wks</i>. 1.
234: ‘She were an excellent lady, but that her face peeleth like
Muscovy glass.’ Reed (<i>Old Plays</i> 4. 38) quotes from Giles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Fletcher’s <i>Russe Commonwealth</i>, 1591, p. 10: ‘In the province of
Corelia, and about the river Duyna towards the North-sea, there
groweth a soft rock which they call Slude. This they cut into pieces,
and so tear it into thin <i>flakes, which naturally it is apt for</i>, and
so use it for glasse lanthorns and such like. It giveth both inwards
and outwards a clearer light then glasse, and for this respect is
better than either glasse or horne; for that it neither breaketh like
glasse, nor yet will burne like the lanthorne.’ Dekker <i>(Non-dram.
Wks.</i> 2. 135) speaks of a ‘Muscouie Lanthorne.’ See Gloss.</p>

<p><b>22 the Diuell of Edmunton.</b> <i>The Merry Devil of Edmunton</i>
was acted by the King’s Men at the Globe before Oct. 22, 1607. It has
been conjecturally assigned to Shakespeare and to Drayton. Hazlitt
describes it as ‘perhaps the first example of sentimental comedy
we have’ (see <i>O. Pl.</i>, 4th ed., 10. 203 f.). Fleay, who believes
Drayton to be the author, thinks that the ‘Merry devil’ of <i>The
Merchant of Venice</i> 2. 3, alludes to this play (<i>Biog. Chron.</i>
1. 151 and 2. 213). There were six editions in the 17th century, all
in quarto&mdash;1608, 1612, 1617, 1626, 1631, 1655. Middleton, <i>The
Black Book</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 8. 36, alludes to it pleasantly in connection
with <i>A Woman kill’d with Kindness</i>. Genest mentions it as being
revived in 1682. Cf. also <i>Staple of News</i>, 1st Int.</p>

<p><b>26 If this Play doe not like</b>, etc. Jonson refers to
Dekker’s play of 1612 (see Introduction, <a href="#Page_xxix">p. xxix</a>). On the title-page
of this play we find <i>If it be not good, The Diuel is in it</i>. At
the head of Act. 1, however, the title reads <i>If this be not a good
play</i>, etc.</p>

<h3>ACT I.</h3>

<p><b>1. 1. 1 Hoh, hoh</b>, etc. ‘Whalley is right in saying that
this is the conventional way for the devil to make his appearance in
the old morality-plays. Gifford objects on the ground that ‘it is
not the roar of terror; but the boisterous expression of sarcastic
merriment at the absurd petition of Pug;’ an objection, the truth of
which does not necessarily invalidate Whalley’s statement. Jonson of
course adapts the old conventions to his own ends. See Introduction, <a href="#Page_xxiii">p. xxiii</a>.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 9 Entring a Sow, to make her cast her farrow?</b> Cf. Dekker,
etc., <i>Witch of Edmonton</i> (<i>Wks.</i> 4. 423): ‘<i>Countr.</i> I’ll be
sworn, <i>Mr. Carter</i>, she bewitched Gammer <i>Washbowls</i> sow, to cast
her Pigs a day before she would have farried.’</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 11 Totnam.</b> ‘The first notice of Tottenham Court, as a
place of public entertainment, contained in the books of the parish
of St. Gile’s-in-the-Fields, occurs under the year 1645 (Wh-C.).
Jonson, however, as early as 1614 speaks of ‘courting it to Totnam
to eat cream’ (<i>Bart. Fair</i>, Act 1. Sc. 1, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 362).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
George Wither, in the <i>Britain’s Remembrancer</i>, 1628,
refers to the same thing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">And Hogsdone, Islington, and Tothnam-court,</span>
<span class="i5">For cakes and cream had then no small resort.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Tottenham Fields were until a comparatively recent date a favorite
place of entertainment.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 13 a tonning of Ale</b>, etc. Cf. <i>Sad Shep.</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 6. 276:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">The house wives tun not work, nor the milk churn.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>1. 1. 15 Spight o’ the housewiues cord, or her hot spit.</b>
‘There be twentie severall waies to make your butter come, which
for brevitie I omit; as to bind your cherne with a rope, to
thrust thereinto a red hot spit, &amp;c.’&mdash;Scot, <i>Discovery</i>, p. 229.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 16, 17 Or some good Ribibe ... witch.</b> This seems
to be an allusion, as Fleay suggests, to Heywood’s <i>Wise-Woman of
Hogsdon</i>. The witch of that play declares her dwelling to be in
‘Kentstreet’ (Heywood’s <i>Wks.</i> 5. 294). A ribibe meant originally
a musical instrument, and was synonymous with rebec. By analogy,
perhaps, it was applied to a shrill-voiced old woman. This is
Gifford’s explanation. The word occurs again in Skelton’s <i>Elynour
Rummyng</i>, l. 492, and in Chaucer, <i>The Freres Tale</i>, l. 1377:
‘a widwe, an old ribybe.’ Skeat offers the following explanation:
‘I suspect that this old joke, for such it clearly is, arose in a very
different way [from that suggested by Gifford], viz. from a pun upon
<i>rebekke</i>, a fiddle, and <i>Rebekke</i>, a married woman, from the
mention of Rebecca in the marriage-service. Chaucer himself notices the
latter in E. 1704.’</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 16 Kentish Towne.</b> Kentish Town, Cantelows, or
Cantelupe town is the most ancient district in the parish of Pancras.
It was originally a small village, and as late as the eighteenth
century a lonely and somewhat dangerous spot. In later years it
became noted for its Assembly Rooms. In 1809 Hughson (<i>London</i>
6. 369) called it ‘the most romantic hamlet in the parish of Pancras.’
It is now a part of the metropolis. See Samuel Palmer’s
<i>St. Pancras</i>, London, 1870.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 17 Hogsden.</b> Stow (<i>Survey</i>, ed. Thoms, p. 158)
describes Hogsden as a ‘large street with houses on both sides.’ It
was a prebend belonging to St. Paul’s. In Hogsden fields Jonson killed
Gabriel Spenser in a duel in 1598. These fields were a great resort
for the citizens on a holiday. The eating of cream there is frequently
mentioned. See the quotation from Wither under note 1. 1. 11, and
<i>Alchemist</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 155 and 175:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i13">&mdash;&mdash;Ay, he would have built</span>
<span class="i5">The city new; and made a ditch about it</span>
<span class="i5">Of silver, should have run with cream from Hogsden.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Stephen in <i>Every Man in</i> dwelt here, and so was forced to
associate with ‘the archers of Finsbury, or the citizens that come
a-ducking to Islington ponds.’ Hogsden or Hoxton, as it is now
called, is to-day a populous district of the metropolis.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 18 shee will not let you play round Robbin.</b> The
expression is obscure, and the dictionaries afford little help.
Round-robin is a common enough phrase, but none of the meanings
recorded is applicable in this connection. Some child’s game, played
in a circle, seems to be referred to, or the expression may be a cant
term for ‘play the deuce.’ Robin is a name of many associations, and
its connection with Robin Hood, Robin Goodfellow, and ‘Robert’s Men’
(‘The third old rank of the Canting crew.’&mdash;Grose.) makes such
an interpretation more or less probable.</p>

<p>M. N. G. in <i>N. &amp; Q.</i> 9th Ser. 10. 394 says that ‘when a
man does a thing in a circuitous, involved manner he is sometimes said
“to go all round Robin Hood’s barn to do it.”’ ‘Round Robin Hood’s
barn’ may possibly have been the name of a game which has been
shortened to ‘round Robin.’</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 21 By a Middlesex Iury.</b> ‘A reproof no less severe
than merited. It appears from the records of those times, that many
unfortunate creatures were condemned and executed on charges of the
rediculous nature here enumerated. In many instances, the judge
was well convinced of the innocence of the accused, and laboured
to save them; but such were the gross and barbarous prejudices of
the juries, that they would seldom listen to his recommendations;
and he was deterred from shewing mercy, in the last place by the
brutal ferociousness of the people, <i>whose teeth were set on edge
with’t</i>, and who clamoured tumultuously for the murder of the
accused.’&mdash;G.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 32 Lancashire.</b> This, as Gifford says, ‘was the very
hot-bed of witches.’ Fifteen were brought to trial on Aug. 19, 1612,
twelve of whom were convicted and burnt on the day after their
trial ‘at the common place of execution near to Lancaster.’ The
term ‘Lancashire Witches’ is now applied to the beautiful women for
which the country is famed. The details of the Lancaster trial are
contained in Potts’ <i>Discoverie</i> (Lond. 1613), and a satisfactory
account is given by Wright in his <i>Sorcery and Magic</i>.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 33 or some parts of Northumberland.</b> The first
witch-trial in Northumberland, so far as I have been able to
ascertain, occurred in 1628. This was the trial of the Witch of
Leeplish.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 37 a Vice.</b> See Introduction, <a href="#Page_xxxiv">pp. xxxiv f</a>.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 38 To practice there-with any play-fellow.</b> See
variants. The editors by dropping the hyphen have completely changed
the sense of the passage. Pug wants a vice in order that he may
corrupt his play-fellows <i>there-with</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>


<p class="no-indent"><b>1. 1. 41 ff.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Why, any Fraud;</b><br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Or Couetousnesse; or Lady Vanity;</b><br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Or old Iniquity</b>. Fraud is a character in Robert Wilson’s
<i>The Three Ladies of London</i>, printed 1584, and <i>The Three Lords
and Three Ladies of London</i>, c 1588, printed 1590. Covetousness
appears in <i>Robin Conscience</i>, c 1530, and is applied to one of the
characters in <i>The Staple of News</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 5. 216. Vanity is one
of the characters in <i>Lusty Juventus</i> (see note <a href="#Note_1_1_50">1. 1. 50</a>)
and in <i>Contention between Liberality and Prodigality</i>, printed 1602
(<i>O. Pl.</i> 4th ed., 8. 328). She seems to have been a favorite with the
later dramatists, and is frequently mentioned (<i>I Henry IV.</i> 2. 4;
<i>Lear</i> 2. 2; <i>Jew of Malta</i> 2. 3, Marlowe’s <i>Wks.</i> 2. 45). Jonson
speaks of her again in <i>The Fox</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 3. 218. For Iniquity see
Introduction, p. xxxviii.</p>

<p>The change in punctuation (see variants), as well as that two
lines below, was first suggested by Upton in a note appended to his
<i>Critical Observations on Shakespeare</i>. Whalley silently adopted the
reading in both cases.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 43 I’ll call him hither.</b> See variants. Coleridge,
<i>Notes</i>, p. 280, says: ‘That is, against all probability, and with
a (for Jonson) impossible violation of character. The words plainly
belong to Pug, and mark at once his simpleness and his impatience.’
Cunningham says that he arrived independently at the same conclusion,
and points out that it is plain from Iniquity’s opening speech that
<i>he</i> understood the words to be Pug’s.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 49 thy dagger.</b> See note <a href="#Note_1_1_85">1. 1. 85</a>.</p>

<p><b><a name="Note_1_1_50"></a>1. 1. 50 lusty Iuuentus.</b> The morality-play
of <i>Lusty Juventus</i> was written by R. Wever about 1550. It ‘breathes the
spirit of the dogmatic reformation of the Protector Somerset,’ but ‘in
spite of its abundant theology it is neither ill written, nor ill
constructed’ (Ward, <i>Eng. Drama</i> 1. 125). It seems to have been very
popular, and the expression ‘a lusty Juventus’ became proverbial. It
is used as early as 1582 by Stanyhurst, <i>Aeneis</i> 2 (Arber). 64 and as
late as Heywood’s <i>Wise Woman of Hogsdon</i> (c 1638), where a gallant
is apostrophised as Lusty Juventus (Act 4). (See Nares and <i>NED</i>.)
Portions of the play had been revived not many years before this
within the tragedy of <i>Thomas More</i> (1590, acc. to Fleay 1596) under
the title of <i>The Mariage of Witt and Wisedome</i>. ‘By dogs precyous
woundes’ is one of the oaths used by Lusty Juventus in the old play,
and may be the ‘Gogs-nownes’ referred to here (<i>O. Pl.</i>, 4th ed., 2.
84). ‘Gogs nowns’ is used several times in <i>Like will to Like</i> (<i>O.
Pl.</i>, 4th ed., 3. 327, 331, etc.).</p>

Shakespeare was born had a penthouse along a portion of it.’ In

points out, Iniquity is boasting of an impossible feat. St. Paul’s steeple had
been destroyed by fire in 1561, and was not yet restored. Several
attempts were made and money collected. ‘James I. countenanced a
sermon at <i>Paul’s Cross</i> in favor of so pious an undertaking, but
nothing was done till 1633 when reparations commenced with some
activity, and Inigo Jones designed, at the expense of Charles I.,
a classic portico to a Gothic church.’&mdash;Wh-C.</p>

<p>Lupton, <i>London Carbonadoed</i>, 1632, writes: ‘The head of St.
Paul’s hath twice been troubled with a burning fever, and so the
city, to keep it from a third danger, lets it stand without a head.’
Gifford says that ‘the Puritans took a malignant pleasure in this
mutilated state of the cathedral.’ Jonson refers to the disaster
in his <i>Execration upon Vulcan</i>, <i>U. 61</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 8. 408.
See also Dekker, <i>Paules Steeples complaint</i>, <i>Non-dram. Wks.</i> 4. 2.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 56 Standard in Cheepe.</b> This was a water-stand or

were formerly held. It was in a ruinous condition in 1442, when it
was repaired by a patent from Henry VI. Stow (<i>Survey</i>, ed. Thoms,
p. 100) gives a list of famous executions at this place, and says
that ‘in the year 1399, Henry IV. caused the blanch charters made by

tailor’s needle was in cant language commonly termed a <i>Spanish pike</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>References to the Spanish needle are frequent. It is mentioned by
Jonson in <i>Chloridia</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 8. 99; by Dekker, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 308;
and by Greene, <i>Wks.</i> 11. 241. Howes (p. 1038) says: ‘The making of Spanish
Needles, was first taught in England by Elias Crowse, a Germane,
about the eight yeare of Queene Elizabeth, and in Queen Maries time,
there was a Negro made fine Spanish Needles in Cheape-side, but would
neuer teach his Art to any.’</p>

Harts Dreame</i>, 1592: ‘The suburbs of the citie are in many places no
other but dark dennes for adulterers, thieves, murderers, and every
mischief worker; daily experience before the magistrates confirms
this for truth.’ Cf. also Glapthorne, <i>Wit in a Constable</i>,

<p><b>1. 1. 60 Petticoate-lane.</b> This is the present Middlesex
Street, Whitechapel. It was formerly called Hog Lane and was
beautified with ‘fair hedge-rows,’ but by Stow’s time it had been
made ‘a continual building throughout of garden houses and small
cottages’ (<i>Survey</i>, ed. 1633, p. 120 b). Strype tells us that the
house of the Spanish Ambassador, supposedly the famous Gondomar, was
situated there (<i>Survey</i> 2. 28). In his day the inhabitants were
French Protestant weavers, and later Jews of a disreputable sort.
That its reputation was somewhat unsavory as early as Nash’s time we
learn from his <i>Prognostication</i> (<i>Wks.</i> 2. 149):</p>

<p>‘If the Beadelles of Bridewell be carefull this Summer, it may be
hoped that Peticote lane may be lesse pestered with ill aires than it
was woont: and the houses there so cleere clensed, that honest women
may dwell there without any dread of the whip and the carte.’ Cf.
also <i>Penniless Parliament, Old Book Collector’s Misc.</i> 2. 16: ‘Many
men shall be so venturously given, as they shall go into Petticoat
Lane, and yet come out again as honestly as they went first in.’</p>

lodging-houses,&mdash;a district unwholesome to approach and unsafe

<span class="i0"><b>To drinke with the Dutch there, and take forth their patternes.</b></span>
</div></div>

<p>Saint Kathernes was the name of a hospital and precinct without
London. The hospital was said to have been founded by Queen
Matilda, wife of King Stephen. In <i>The Alchemist</i> (<i>Wks.</i> 4. 161),
Jonson speaks of its having been used ‘to keep the better sort of
mad-folks.’ It was also employed as a reformatory for fallen women,
and it is here that Winifred in <i>Eastward Ho</i> (ed. Schelling, p. 84)
finds an appropriate landing-place.</p>

<p>From this hospital there was ‘a continual street, or filthy
strait passage, with alleys of small tenements, or cottages, built,
inhabited by sailors’ victuallers, along by the river of Thames,
almost to Radcliff, a good mile from the Tower.’&mdash;Stow, ed.
Thoms, p. 157.</p>

<p>The precinct was noted for its brew-houses and low drinking
places. In <i>The Staple of News</i> Jonson speaks of ‘an ale-wife in
Saint Katherine’s, At the Sign of the Dancing Bears’ (<i>Wks.</i> 5. 226).
The same tavern is referred to in the <i>Masque of Augurs</i> as well as
‘the brew-houses in St. Katherine’s.’ The sights of the place are
enumerated in the same masque.</p>

<p>The present passage seems to indicate that the precinct was
largely inhabited by Dutch. In the <i>Masque of Augurs</i> Vangoose speaks
a sort of Dutch jargon, and we know that a Flemish cemetery was
located here (see Wh-C). Cf. also Sir Thomas Overbury’s <i>Character
of A drunken Dutchman resident in England</i>, ed. Morley, p. 72: ‘Let
him come over never so lean, and plant him but one month near the
brew-houses of St. Catherine’s and he will be puffed up to your hand
like a bloat herring.’ Dutch weavers had been imported into England
as early as the reign of Edward III. (see Howes, p. 870 a), and in
the year 1563 great numbers of Netherlanders with their wives and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
children fled into England owing to the civil dissension in Flanders
(Howes, p. 868 a). They bore a reputation for hard drinking (cf.
<i>Like will to Like</i>, <i>O. Pl.</i> 3. 325; Dekker,
<i>Non-dram. Wks.</i> 3. 12; Nash, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 81, etc.).</p>

<p>The phrase ‘to take forth their patternes’ is somewhat obscure,
and seems to have been forced by the necessity for a rhyme. Halliwell
says that ‘take forth’ is equivalent to ‘learn,’ and the phrase seems
therefore to mean ‘take their measure,’ ‘size them up,’ with a view
to following their example. It is possible, of course, that actual
patterns of the Dutch weavers or tailors are referred to.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 63 Custome-house key.</b> This was in Tower Street on the
Thames side. Stow (ed. Thoms, pp. 51. 2) says that the custom-house
was built in the sixth year of Richard II. Jonson mentions the place
again in <i>Every Man in</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 1. 69.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 66 the Dagger, and the Wool-sacke.</b> These were two
ordinaries or public houses of low repute, especially famous for
their pies. There were two taverns called the ‘Dagger,’ one in
Holborn and one in Cheapside. It is probably to the former of these
that Jonson refers. It is mentioned again in the <i>Alchemist</i>
(<i>Wks.</i> 4. 24 and 165) and in Dekker’s <i>Satiromastix</i>
(<i>Wks.</i> 1. 200). Hotten says that the sign of a dagger was
common, and arose from its being a charge in the city arms.</p>

<p>The Woolsack was without Aldgate. It was originally a
wool-maker’s sign. Machyn mentions the tavern in 1555; and it is
alluded to in Dekker, <i>Shoemaker’s Holiday</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 1. 61.
See Wh-C. and Hotten’s <i>History of Signboards</i>, pp. 325 and 362.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 69 Belins-gate.</b> Stow (ed. Thoms, p. 78) describes
Belins-gate as ‘a large water-gate, port or harborough.’ He mentions
the tradition that the name was derived from that of Belin, King of
the Britons, but discredits it. Billingsgate is on the Thames, a
little below London Bridge, and is still the great fish-market of
London.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 70 shoot the Bridge.</b> The waterway under the old
London Bridge was obstructed by the narrowness of the arches, by
cornmills built in some of the openings, and by the great waterworks
at its southern end. ‘Of the arches left open some were too narrow
for the passage of boats of any kind. The widest was only 36 feet,
and the resistance caused to so large a body of water on the rise
and fall of the tide by this contraction of its channel produced a
fall or rapid under the bridge, so that it was necessary to “ship
oars” to <i>shoot the bridge</i>, as it was called,&mdash;an undertaking,
to amateur watermen especially, not unattended with danger. “With
the flood-tide it was impossible, and with the ebb-tide dangerous to
pass through or <i>shoot</i> the arches of the bridge.” In the latter case
prudent passengers landed above the bridge, generally at the <i>Old
Swan Stairs</i>, and walked to some wharf, generally <i>Billingsgate</i>, below it.’&mdash;Wh-C.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p><b>1. 1. 70 the Cranes i’ the Vintry.</b> These were ‘three strong
cranes of timber placed on the Vintry wharf by the Thames to crane
up wine there (Stow, ed. Thoms, p. 00). They were situated in Three
Cranes’ lane, and near by was the famous tavern mentioned as one of
the author’s favorite resorts (<i>Bart. Fair</i> 1. 1, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 356).
Jonson speaks of it again in <i>The Silent Woman</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 3. 376,
and in the <i>Masque of Augurs</i>. Pepys visited the place on January 23,
1662, and describes the best room as ‘a narrow dogg-hole’ in which
he and his friends were crammed so close ‘that it made me loath
my company and victuals, and a sorry dinner it was too.’
Cf. also Dekker, (<i>Non-dram. Wks.</i> 8. 77).</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 72 the Strand.</b> This famous street was formerly the
road between the cities of Westminster and London. That many lawyers
lived in this vicinity we learn from Middleton (<i>Father Hubburd’s
Tales</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 8. 77).</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 73 Westminster-hall.</b> It was once the hall of the
King’s palace at Westminster, originally built by William Rufus. The
present hall was formed 1397-99. Here the early parliaments were
held. ‘This great hall hath been the usual place of pleadings, and
ministration of justice.’&mdash;Stow, ed. Thoms, p. 174.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 75 so Veluet to Leather.</b> Velvet seems to have been
much worn by lawyers. Cf. Overbury, <i>Characters</i>, p. 72: ‘He loves
his friend as a counsellor at law loves the velvet breeches he was
first made barrister in.’</p>

<p><b><a name="Note_1_1_85"></a>1. 1. 85 In his long coat, shaking his

<p><b>1. 1. 93 Cokeley.</b> Whalley says that he was the master of a
puppet show, and this has been accepted by all authorities (Gifford,
ed.; Nares, <i>Gloss</i>.; Alden, ed. of <i>Bart. Fair</i>). He seems, however,
to have been rather an improviser like Vennor, or a mountebank with
a gift of riming. He is mentioned several times by Jonson: <i>Bart.
Fair</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 422, 3: ‘He has not been sent for, and sought out
for nothing, at your great city-suppers, to put down Coriat and
Cokely.’ <i>Epigr.</i>129; <i>To Mime</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 8. 229:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Or, mounted on a stool, thy face doth hit</span>
<span class="i5">On some new gesture, that’s imputed wit?</span>
<span class="i5">&mdash;Thou dost out-zany Cokely, Pod; nay Gue:</span>
<span class="i5">And thine own Coryat too.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>1. 1. 94 Vennor.</b> Gifford first took Vennor to be a
juggler, but corrected his statement in the <i>Masque of Augurs</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 7. 414. He says: ‘Fenner, whom I supposed to be a
juggler, was a rude kind of <i>improvisatore</i>. He was altogether
ignorant; but possessed a wonderful facility in pouring out
doggrel verse. He says of himself,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Yet, without boasting, let me boldly say</span>
<span class="i5">I’ll rhyme with any man that breathes this day</span>
<span class="i5">Upon a subject, in <i>extempore</i>, etc.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>He seems to have made a wretched livelihood by frequenting
city feasts, &amp;c., where, at the end of the entertainment, he
was called in to mount a stool and amuse the company by stringing
together a number of vile rhymes upon any given subject. To this the
quotation alludes. Fenner is noticed by the duchess of Newcastle:
“For the numbers every schoolboy can make them on his fingers, and
for the <i>rime</i>, Fenner would put down Ben Jonson, and yet neither
boy nor Fenner so good poets.” This, too, is the person meant in the
Cambridge answer to Corbet’s satire:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">A ballad late was made,</span>
<span class="i5">But God knows who the penner;</span>
<span class="i5">Some say the rhyming sculler,</span>
<span class="i5">And others say ’twas Fenner. p. 24.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Fenner was so famed for his faculty of rhyming, that James, who,
like Bartholomew Cokes, would willingly let no raree-show escape
him, sent for him to court. Upon which Fenner added to his other
titles that of his “Majesty’s Riming Poet.” This gave offense to
Taylor, the Water poet, and helped to produce that miserable
squabble printed among his works, and from which I have principally
derived the substance of this note.’&mdash;G.</p>

<p>‘In Richard Brome’s <i>Covent Garden Weeded</i> (circ. 1638),
we have: “Sure ’tis Fenner or his ghost. He was a riming souldier.”
(p. 42.)’&mdash;C.</p>

<p>The controversy referred to may be found in the Spenser Society’s
reprint of the 1630 folio of Taylor’s <i>Works</i>, 1869, pp. 304-325.
Here may be gathered a few more facts regarding the life of Fenner
(or Fennor as it should be spelled), among them that he was apprenticed
when a boy to a blind harper. In the quarrel, it must be confessed,
Fennor does not appear markedly inferior to his derider either in
powers of versification or in common decency. The quarrel between
the poets took place in October, 1614, and Fennor’s admittance to
court seems to be referred to in the present passage.</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 95 a Sheriffes dinner.</b> This was an occasion of
considerable extravagance. Entick (<i>Survey</i> 1. 499) tells us
that in 1543 a sumptuary law was passed ‘to prevent luxurious
eating or feasting in a time of scarcity; whereby it was
ordained, that the lord-mayor should not have more than seven
dishes at dinner or supper,’ and ‘an alderman and sheriff no
more than six.’</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 96 Skip with a rime o’ the Table, from New-nothing.</b>
What is meant by <i>New-nothing</i> I do not know. From the
construction it would seem to indicate the place from which
the fool was accustomed to take his leap, but it is possible
that the word should be connected with <i>rime</i>, and may perhaps
be the translation of a Greek or Latin title for some book of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
<i>facetiae</i> published about this time. Such wits as Fennor and
Taylor doubtless produced many pamphlets, the titles of which
have not been recorded. In 1622 Taylor brought out a collection
of verse called ‘Sir Gregory Non-sense His Newes from no place,’
and it may have been this very book in manuscript that suggested
Jonson’s title. In the play of <i>King Darius</i>, 1106, one of the
actors says: ‘I had rather then my new nothing, I were gon.’</p>

<p><b>1. 1. 97 his Almaine-leape into a custard.</b> ‘In the
earlier days, when the city kept a fool it was customary for him
at public entertainments, to leap into a large bowl of custard
set on purpose.’&mdash;W. Whalley refers also to <i>All’s well that
Ends Well</i> 2. 5: ‘You have made a shift to run into it, boots
and all, like him that leapt into the custard.’</p>

<p>Gifford quotes Glapthorne, <i>Wit in a Const.</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">The custard, with the four and twenty nooks</span>
<span class="i5">At my lord Mayor’s feast.</span>
</div></div>

<p>He continues: ‘Indeed, no common supply was required; for,
besides what the Corporation (great devourers of custard)
consumed on the spot, it appears that it was thought no breach
of city manners to send, or take some of it home with them for
the use of their ladies.’ In the excellent old play quoted
above, Clara twits her uncle with this practise:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Now shall you, sir, as ’tis a frequent custom,</span>
<span class="i5">‘Cause you’re a worthy alderman of a ward,</span>
<span class="i5">Feed me with custard, and perpetual white broth</span>
<span class="i5">Sent from the lord Mayor’s feast.’</span>
</div></div>

<p>Cunningham says: ‘Poets of a comparatively recent date continue
to associate mayors and custards.’ He Quotes Prior <i>(Alma</i>,
Cant. 1) and a letter from Bishop Warburton to Hurd (Apr.
1766): ‘I told him (the Lord Mayor) in what I thought he was
defective&mdash;that I was greatly disappointed to see no custard at
table. He said that they had been so ridiculed for their custard
that none had ventured to make its appearance for some years.’
Jonson mentions the ‘quaking custards’ again in <i>The Fox</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 3. 164., and in <i>The Staple of News</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 5. 196, 7.</p>

<p>An Almain-leap was a dancing leap. ‘Allemands were danced
here a few years back’ (Nares). Cunningham quotes from Dyce:
‘Rabelais tells us that Gargantua “wrestled, ran, jumped, not at
three steps and a leap, ... nor yet at the Almane’s, for, said
Gymnast, these jumps are for the wars altogether unprofitable
and of no use.” <i>Rabelais</i>, Book 1, C. 23.’</p>

<p>Bishop Barlow, <i>Answer to a Catholike Englishman</i>, p. 231, Lond.
1607, says: ‘Now heere the Censurer makes an Almaine leape,
skipping 3 whole pages together’ (quoted in <i>N. &amp; Q.</i> 1st Ser. 10. 157).

<p>When Simon Eyre is appointed sheriff, his wife immediately
inquires for a ‘Fardingale-maker’ and a ‘French-hood maker’
(Dekker, <i>Wks.</i> 1. 39). Strutt says that French hoods were out
of fashion by the middle of the 17th century (<i>Antiq.</i> 3. 93).
See the frequent references to this article of apparel in <i>Bart.

colored. In Middleton and Rowley’s <i>World Tossed at Tennis</i>
five different colored starches are personified. Stubbes says
that it was ‘of all collours and hues.’ Yellow starch must have
come into fashion not long before this play was acted, for in
the <i>Owle’s Allmanacke</i>, published in 1618, it is said: ‘Since
yellow bandes and saffroned chaperoones came vp, is not above
two yeeres past.’ This, however, is not to be taken literally,
for the execution of Mrs. Turner took place Nov. 14, 1615. Of
her we read in Howell’s Letters 1. 2: ‘Mistress <i>Turner</i>, the
first inventress of <i>yellow Starch</i>, was executed in a Cobweb
Lawn Ruff of that colour at <i>Tyburn</i>; and with her I believe
that <i>yellow Starch</i>, which so much disfigured our Nation, and
rendered them so ridiculous and fantastic, will receive its
Funeral.’ Sir S. D’Ewes <i>(Autobiog.</i> 1. 69) says that from that
day it did, indeed, grow ‘generally to be detested and disused.’
<i>The Vision of Sir Thomas Overbury</i>, 1616 (quoted in Amos,
<i>Great Oyer</i>, p. 50) speaks of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">&mdash;&mdash;that fantastic, ugly fall and ruff</span>
<span class="i5">Daub’d o’er with that base starch of yellow stuff</span>
</div></div>

<p class="no-indent">as already out of fashion. Its popularity must have
returned, however, since Barnaby Riche in the <i>Irish Hubbub</i>,1622,
p. 40, laments that ‘yellow starcht bands’ were more popular than
ever, and he prophesies that the fashion ‘shortly will be as
conversant amongst taylors, tapsters, and tinkers, as now they
have brought tobacco.’</p>

<p>D’Ewes also in describing the procession of King James from
Whitehall to Westminster, Jan. 30, 1620, says that the king
saw one window ‘full of gentlewomen or ladies, all in yellow
bandes,’ whereupon he called out ‘A pox take yee,’ and they all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
withdrew in shame. In <i>The Parson’s Wedding</i>, printed 1664, <i>O.
Pl.</i> 11. 498, it is spoken of as out of fashion. Yellow starch
is mentioned again in 5. 8. 74. 5, and a ballad of ‘goose-green
starch and the devil’ is mentioned in <i>Bart. Fair</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 4.
393. Similarly, Nash speaks in <i>Pierce Pennilesse</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2.
44. of a ‘Ballet of Blue starch and poaking stick.’ See also
Dodsley’s note on <i>Albumazar</i>, <i>O. Pl.</i> 7. 132.</p>

defined B. E. <i>Dict. Cant. Crew, Hum</i> or <i>Humming Liquor</i>, Double Ale,
Stout, Pharoah. It is mentioned in Fletcher’s <i>Wild Goose Chase</i> 2. 3
and Heywood’s <i>Drunkard</i>. p. 48. Meath or mead is still made
in England. It was a favorite drink in the Middle Ages, and
consisted of a mixture of honey and water with the addition of
a ferment. Harrison, <i>Description of England</i>, ed. Furnivall,
1. 161, thus describes it: ‘There is a kind of swish swash made
also in Essex, and diuerse other places, with honicombs and
water, which the [homelie] countrie wiues, putting some pepper
and a little other spice among, call mead, verie good in mine
opinion for such as loue to be loose bodied [at large, or a
little eased of the cough,] otherwise it differeth so much from
the true metheglin, as chalke from cheese.’</p>

<p>Obarni was long a crux for the editors and dictionaries. Gifford
(<i>Wks.</i> 7. 226) supplied a part of the quotation from <i>Pimlyco or
Runne Red-Cap</i>, 1609, completed by James Platt, Jun. (<i>N. &amp; Q.</i>
9th Ser. 3. 306). in which ‘Mead Obarne and Mead Cherunk’ are
mentioned as drinks</p>

<p>Mr. Platt first instanced the existing Russian word <i>obarni</i>
or <i>obvarnyi</i> (see Gloss.), meaning ‘boiling, scalding,’ and
C. C. B. (<i>N. &amp; Q.</i> 9. 3. 413) supplied a quotation from the
account of the voyage of Sir Jerome Bowes in 1583 (Harris’s
<i>Travels</i> 1. 535), in which ‘Sodden Mead’ appears among the
items of diet supplied by the Emperor to the English Ambassador.
The identification was completed with a quotation given by the

<p>Fleay identifies him with Norbret, one of the astrologers in
Beaumont and Fletcher’s <i>Rollo, Duke of Normandy</i>.</p>

<p><b><a name="Note_1_2_2"></a>1. 2. 2 Gresham.</b> A pretended astrologer,
contemporary with Forman, and said to be one of the associates of the infamous
Countess of Essex and Mrs. Turner in the murder of Sir Thomas
Overbury. Arthur Wilson mentions him in <i>The Life of James I.</i>, p. 70:</p>

<p>‘Mrs. <i>Turner</i>, the Mistris of the <i>Work</i>, had lost both her
supporters. <i>Forman</i>, her first prop, drop’t away suddenly by
death; and <i>Gresham</i> another rotten <i>Engin</i> (that succeded him)
did not hold long: She must now bear up all her self.’</p>

<p>He is mentioned twice in Spark’s <i>Narrative History of King
James</i>, Somer’s <i>Tracts</i> 2. 275: ‘Dr. Forman being dead, Mrs.
Turner wanted one to assist her; whereupon, at the countesses
coming to London, one Gresham was nominated to be entertained in
this businesse, and, in processe of time, was wholly interested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
in it; this man was had in suspition to have had a hand in the
Gunpowder plot, he wrote so near it in his almanack; but, without all
question, he was a very skilful man in the mathematicks, and, in
his latter time, in witchcraft, as was suspected, and therefore the
fitter to bee imployed in those practises, which, as they were devilish,
so the devil had a hand in them.’</p>

<p><i>Ibid.</i> 287: ‘Now Gresham growing into years, having spent much
time in many foule practises to accomplish those things at this
time, gathers all his babies together, <i>viz.</i> pictures in lead,
in wax, in plates of gold, of naked men and women with crosses,
crucifixes, and other implements, wrapping them all up together
in a scarfe, crossed every letter in the sacred word Trinity,
crossed these things very holily delivered into the hands of one
Weston to bee hid in the earth that no man might find them, and
so in Thames-street having finished his evill times he died,
leaving behind him a man and a maid, one hanged for a witch, and
the other for a thief very shortly after.’</p>

<p>In the ‘Heads of Charges against Robert, Earl of Somerset’,
drawn up by Lord Bacon, we read: ‘That the countess laboured
Forman and Gresham to inforce the Queen by witchcraft to favour
the countess’ (Howell’s <i>State Trials</i> 2. 966). To this King
James replied in an ‘Apostyle,’ <i>Nothing to Somerset</i>. This
exhausts the references to Gresham that I have been able to
find. See note on Savory, <a href="#Note_1_2_3">1. 2. 3.</a></p>

<p><b>1. 2. 2. Fore-man.</b> Simon Foreman, or Forman (1552-1611)
was the most famous of the group of quacks here mentioned. He
studied at Oxford, 1573-1578, and in 1579 began his career as
a necromancer. He claimed the power to discover lost treasure,
and was especially successful in his dealings with women. A
detailed account of his life is given in the <i>DNB</i>. and a short
but interesting sketch in <i>Social England</i> 4. 87. The chief
sources are Wm. Lilly’s <i>History</i> and a diary from 1564 to 1602,
with an account of Forman’s early life, published by Mr. J. O.
Halliwell-Phillipps for the Camden Soc., 1843.</p>

<p>He is mentioned again by Jonson in <i>Silent Woman</i>, <i>Wks.</i>
3. 413: ‘<i>Daup.</i> I would say, thou hadst the best philtre in the
world, and couldst do more than Madam Medea, or Doctor Foreman.’
In <i>Sir Thomas Overbury’s Vision</i> (Harl. Ms., vol. 7, quoted in
D’Ewes’ <i>Autobiog.</i>, p. 89) he is spoken of as ‘that fiend in human shape.’</p>

<p><b><a name="Note_1_2_3"></a>1. 2. 3 Francklin.</b> Francklin was an apothecary,
and procured the poison for Mrs. Turner (see Amos, <i>Great Oyer</i>. p. 97).
He was one of the three persons executed with Mrs. Turner.
Arthur Wilson, in his <i>Life of James I.</i> (p. 70), describes him
as ‘a swarthy, sallow, crooked-backt fellow, who was to be the
<i>Fountain</i> whence these bitter waters came.’ See also Somer’s
<i>Tracts</i> 2. 287. The poem already quoted furnishes a description of Francklin:

<p><b>1. 2. 3 Fiske.</b> ‘In this year 1633, I became acquainted
with Nicholas Fiske, licentiate in physick, who was borne in
Suffolk, near Framingham [Framlingham] Castle, of very good
parentage.... He was a person very studious, laborious, and of
good apprehension.... He was exquisitely skilful in the art of
directions upon nativities, and had a good genius in performing
judgment thereupon.... He died about the seventy-eighth year of
his age, poor.’&mdash;Lilly, <i>Hist.</i>, p. 42 f.</p>

<p>Fiske appears as La Fiske in <i>Rollo, Duke of Normandy</i>, and is
also mentioned by Butler, <i>Hudibr</i>., Part 2, Cant. 3. 403:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><b>1. 2. 3 Sauory.</b> ‘And therefore, she fearing that her
lord would seek some public or private revenge against her, by
the advice of the before-mentioned Mrs. Turner, consulted and
practised with Doctor Forman and Doctor Savory, two conjurers,
about the poisoning of him.’&mdash;D’Ewes, <i>Autobiog.</i> 1. 88. 9.</p>

<p>He was employed after the sudden death of Dr. Forman. Wright
(<i>Sorcery and Magic</i>, p. 228) says that the name is written
Lavoire in some manuscripts. ‘Mrs. Turner also confessed, that
Dr. Savories was used in succession, after Forman, and practised
many sorceries upon the Earle of Essex his person.’&mdash;Spark,
<i>Narrative History</i>, Somer’s <i>Tracts</i> 2. 333.</p>

<p>In the <i>Calendar of State Papers</i> the name of ‘Savery’
appears four times. Under date of Oct. 16, 1615, we find Dr. Savery
examined on a charge of ‘spreading Popish Books.’ ‘Savery
pretends to be a doctor, but is probably a conjurer.’ And again
under the same date he is interrogated as to his relations with
Mrs. Turner and Forman. Under Oct. 24 he replies to Coke. ‘Oct.
?’ we find Dr. Savery questioned as to his ‘predictions of
troubles and alterations in Court.’ This is the last mention of him.</p>

<p>Just what connection Gresham and Savory had with the Overbury
plot is a difficult matter to determine. Both are spoken of as
following Forman immediately, and of neither is any successor
mentioned except the actual poisoner, Franklin. It seems
probable that Gresham was the first to be employed after Forman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and that his own speedy death led to the selection of Savory.
How the latter managed to escape a more serious implication in
the trial it is difficult to conceive.</p>

<p><b><a name="Note_1_2_6"></a>1. 2. 6-9 christalls, ... characters.</b>
As in other fields, Jonson is well versed in magic lore. Lumps of crystal
were one of the regular means of raising a demon. Bk. 15, Ch. 16 of
Scot’s <i>Discovery of Witchcraft</i>, 1584, is entitled: ‘To make a
spirit appear in a christall’, and Ch. 12 shows ‘How to enclose
a spirit in a christall stone.’</p>

<p>Lilly (<i>History</i>, p. 78) speaks of the efficacy of ‘a
constellated ring’ in sickness, and they were doubtless
considered effective in more sinister dealings. Jonson has
already spoken of the devil being carried in a thumb-ring
(<a href="#Page_6">see note P. 6</a>).</p>

<p>Charms were usually written on parchment. In Barrett’s <i>Magus</i>,
Bk. 2, Pt. 3. 109, we read that the pentacle should be drawn
‘upon parchment made of a kid-skin, or virgin, or pure clean white paper.’</p>

<p>That parts of the human body belonged to the sorcerer’s
paraphernalia is shown by the Statute 1 Jac. I. c. xii, which
contains a clause forbidding conjurors to ‘take up any dead
man woman or child out of his her or their grave ... or the
skin bone or any other parte of any dead person, to be imployed
or used in any manner of Witchcrafte Sorcerie Charme or Inchantment.’</p>

<p>The wing of the raven, as a bird of ill omen, may be an
invention of Jonson’s own. The lighting of candles within the
magic circle is mentioned below (note 1. 2. 26).</p>

<p>Most powerful of all was the pentacle, of which Scot’s
<i>Discovery</i> (Ap. II, p. 533, 4) furnishes an elaborate
description. This figure was used by the Pythagorean school as
their seal, and is equivalent to the pentagram or five-pointed
star (see <i>CD.</i>).</p>

<p>Dekker (<i>Wks.</i> 2. 200) connects it with the Periapt as a ‘potent
charm,’ and Marlowe speaks of it in <i>Hero and Leander</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 3. 45:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">A rich disparent pentacle she wears,</span>
<span class="i5">Drawn full of circles and strange characters.</span>
</div></div>

<p>It will be remembered that the inscription of a pentagram on
the threshold prevents the escape of Mephistopheles in Goethe’s
<i>Faust</i>. The editors explain its potency as due to the fact that
it is resolvable into three triangles, and is thus a triple sign
of the Trinity.</p>

<p>Cunningham says that the pentacle ‘when delineated upon the
body of a man was supposed to point out the five wounds of the
Saviour.’ W. J. Thoms (<i>Anecdotes</i>, Camden Soc., 1839, p. 97)
speaks of its presence in the western window of the southern
aisle of Westminster Abbey, an indication that the monks were versed in occult science.

<p><b>1. 2. 21 If they be not.</b> Gifford refers to Chrysippus,

augury.’</p>

<p><b><a name="Note_1_2_22"></a>1. 2. 22 Why, are there lawes against ’hem?</b>
It was found necessary in 1541 to pass an act (33 Hen. VIII. c. 8) by
which&mdash;‘it shall be felony to practise, or cause to be practised
conjuration, witchcrafte, enchantment, or sorcery, to get
money: or to consume any person in his body, members or goods;
or to provoke any person to unlawful love; or for the despight
of Christ, or lucre of money, to pull down any cross; or to
declare where goods stolen be.’ Another law was passed 1 Edward
VI. c. 12 (1547). 5 Elizabeth. c. 16 (1562) gives the ‘several
penalties of conjuration, or invocation of wicked spirits, and
witchcraft, enchantment, charm or sorcery.’ Under Jas. I, anno
secundo (vulgo primo), c. 12, still another law was passed,
whereby the second offense was declared a felony. The former act
of Elizabeth was repealed. This act of James was not repealed
until 9 George II. c. 5.</p>

<p><i>Social England</i>, p. 270, quotes from Ms. Lansdowne,
2. Art. 26, a deposition from William Wicherley, conjurer, in which
he places the number of conjurers in England in 1549 above five
hundred. A good idea of the character of the more disreputable
type of conjurer can be got from Beaumont and Fletcher’s
<i>Fair Maid of the Inn</i>. See especially Act 5, Sc. 2.</p>

<p><b>1. 2. 26 circles.</b> The magic circle is one of the things
most frequently mentioned among the arts of the conjurer. Scot
(<i>Discovery</i>, p. 476) has a long satirical passage on the
subject, in which he enjoins the conjurer to draw a double
circle with his own blood, to divide the circle into seven
parts and to set at each division a ‘candle lighted in a brazen candlestick.’</p>

<p><b>1. 2. 27 his hard names.</b> A long list of the ‘diverse

<i>Eastward Hoe</i>: ‘Ger. As I am a lady, I think I am with child
already, I long for a coach so.’ Dekker, <i>Shomakers Holiday</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 1. 17: ‘I am with child till I behold this huffecap.’ The
humors of the longing wife are a constant subject of ridicule.

<p>The form ‘cater’, however, is common enough. Indeed, if we are

<p><b>1. 3. 34 Of Derby-shire, S<sup>r</sup>. about the Peake.</b> Jonson
seems to have been well acquainted with the wonders of the Peak
of Derbyshire. Two of his masques, <i>The Gipsies Metamorphosed</i>,
acted first at Burleigh on the Hill, and later at Belvoir,
Nottinghamshire, and <i>Love’s Welcome at Welbeck</i>, acted in 1633
at Welbeck, Nottinghamshire, the seat of William Cavendish, Earl
of Newcastle, are full of allusions to them. The Devil’s Arse
seems to be the cavern now known to travellers as the <i>Peak</i>
or <i>Devil’s Cavern</i>. It is described by Baedeker as upwards of
2,000 feet in extent. One of its features is a subterranean
river known as the Styx. The origin of the cavern’s name is
given in a coarse song in the <i>Gypsies Met.</i>
(<i>Wks.</i> 7. 357), beginning:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Cocklorrel would needs have the Devil his guest,</span>
<span class="i5">And bade him into the Peak to dinner.</span>
</div></div>

<p>In <i>Love’s Welcome</i> Jonson speaks again of ‘Satan’s sumptuous
Arse’, <i>Wks.</i> 8. 122.</p>

<p><b>1. 3. 34, 5.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That Hole.<br />

<p><b>1. 3. 38 Foure pound a yeere.</b> ‘This we may suppose to have
been the customary wages of a domestic servant.’&mdash;C. Cunningham
cites also the passage in the <i>Alchemist</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 12;
‘You were once ... the good, Honest, plain, livery-three-pound-thrum,
that kept Your master’s worship’s house,’ in which he takes the
expression ‘three-pound’ to be the equivalent of ‘badly-paid’.</p>

<p><b>1. 4. 1 I’ll goe lift him.</b> Jonson is never tired of punning
on the names of his characters.</p>

<p><b>1. 4. 5 halfe a piece.</b> ‘It may be necessary to observe,
once for all, that the <i>piece</i> (the double sovereign) went for

two and twenty shillings.’&mdash;G. Compare 3. 3. 83, where a
hundred pieces is evidently somewhat above a hundred pounds.
By a proclamation, Nov. 23, 1611, the piece of gold called the
Unitie, formerly current at twenty shillings was raised to the
value of twenty two shillings (S. M. Leake, <i>Eng. Money</i> 2.
276). Taylor, the water-poet, tells us that Jonson gave him ‘a
piece of gold of two and twenty shillings to drink his health
in England’ (<i>Conversations</i>, quoted in Schelling’s <i>Timber</i>,
p. 105). In the <i>Busie Body</i> Mrs. Centlivre uses <i>piece</i> as
synonymous with <i>guinea</i> (2d ed., pp. 7 and 14).</p>

<p><b>1. 4. 31 Iust what it list.</b> Jonson makes frequent use of the

<p><b>1. 4. 43 Ô here’s the bill, S<sup>r</sup>.</b> Collier says that the
use of play-bills was common prior to the year 1563 (Strype,
<i>Life of Grindall,</i> ed. 1821, p. 122). They are mentioned in
<i>Histriomastix</i>, 1610; <i>A Warning for Fair Women</i>, 1599, etc.

<p><b>1. 4. 71 Keepe warme your wisdome?</b> Cf. <i>Cyn. Rev.</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 2. 241: ‘<i>Madam, your whole self cannot but be perfectly
wise; for your hands have wit enough to keep themselves warm.</i>’
Gifford’s note on this passage is: ‘This proverbial phrase is
found in most (sic) of our ancient dramas. Thus in <i>The Wise
Woman of Hogsden</i>: “You are the wise woman, are you? You <i>have
wit to keep yourself warm enough</i>, I warrant you”’. Cf. also
<i>Lusty Juventus</i>, p. 74: ‘Cover your head; For indeed you have
need to keep in your wit.’</p>

<p><b>1. 4. 72 You lade me.</b> ‘This is equivalent to the modern
phrase, you do not spare me. You lay what imputations you please
upon me.’&mdash;G.</p>

<p>The phrase occurs again in 1. 6. 161, where Wittipol calls
Fitzdottrel an ass, and says that he cannot ‘scape his lading’.
‘You lade me’, then, seems to mean ‘You make an ass of me’.
The same use of the word occurs in Dekker, <i>Olde Fortunatus</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 1. 125: ‘I should serue this bearing asse rarely now, if
I should load him’. And again in the works of Taylor, the Water Poet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
p. 311: ‘My Lines shall load an Asse, or whippe an Ape.’ Cf.
also <i>Bart. Fair</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 421: ‘Yes, faith, I have my
lading, you see, or shall have anon; you may know whose beast I am
by my burden.’</p>

<p><b>1. 4. 83, 4&emsp;&emsp; But, not beyond</b>,<br />
&emsp;<b>A minute, or a second, looke for.</b> The omission of the
comma after <i>beyond</i> by all the later editors destroys the
sense. Fitzdottrel does not mean that Wittipol cannot have
‘beyond a minute’, but that he cannot have a minute beyond the
quarter of an hour allowed him.</p>

<p><b>1. 4. 96 Migniard.</b> ‘Cotgrave has in his dictionary,
“<i>Mignard</i>&mdash;migniard, prettie, quaint, neat, feat, wanton,
dainty, delicate.” In the <i>Staple of News</i> [<i>Wks.</i> 5. 221]
Jonson tries to introduce the substantive <i>migniardise</i>, but
happily without success.’&mdash;G.</p>

<p><b>1. 4. 101 Prince Quintilian.</b> The reputation of this
famous rhetorician (c 35-c 97 A. D.) is based on his great
work entitled <i>De Instiutione Oratoria Libri</i> XII. The first
English edition seems to have been made in 1641, but many
Continental editions had preceded it. The title Prince seems
to be gratuitous on Jonson’s part. He is mentioned again in

<p><b><a name="Note_1_6_18"></a>1. 6. 18 a Niaise.</b> Gifford says that the side
note ‘could scarcely come from Jonson; for it explains nothing. A niaise (or rather
an <i>eyas</i>, of which it is a corruption) is unquestionably a young hawk,
but the niaise of the poet is the French term for, “a simple, witless,
inexperienced gull”, &amp;c. The word is very common in our old writers.’</p>

<p>The last statement is characteristic of Gifford. It would have
been well in this case if he had given some proof of his assertion.
The derivation <i>an eyas</i> &gt; <i>a nyas</i> is probably incorrect. The
<i>Centary Dictionary</i> gives ‘<i>Niaise</i>, <i>nyas</i> (and corruptly <i>eyas</i>,
by misdivision of <i>a nias</i>).’ The best explanation I can give of
the side note is this. The glossator takes the meaning ‘simpleton’
for granted. But Fitzdottrel has just said ‘Laught at, sweet bird?’
In explanation the side note is added. This, perhaps, does not help
matters much and, indeed, I am inclined to believe with Gifford that
the side notes are by another hand than Jonson’s.

<p><b>1. 6. 31 Black-fryers Play-house.</b> This famous theatre was
founded by James Burbage in 1596-7. The Burbages leased it to
Henry Evans for the performances of the Children of the Chapel,
and the King’s Servants acted there after the departure of the
children. In 1619 the Lord Mayor and the Council of London
ordered its discontinuance, but the players were able to keep it
open on the plea that it was a private house. In 1642 ‘public
stage plays’ were suppressed, and on Aug. 5, 1655, Blackfriars
Theatre was pulled down and tenements were built in its place. See Wh-C.</p>

<p>Nares, referring to Shirley’s <i>Six New Playes</i>, 1653, says that
‘the Theatre of Black-Friars was, in Charles I.’s time at least
considered, as being of a higher order and more respectability
than any of those on the Bank-side.’</p>

The gallants of this age were inordinately fond of displaying
their dress, or ‘publishing their suits.’ The play-house and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
‘Paul’s Walk,’ the nave of St. Paul’s Cathedral, were favorite
places for accomplishing this. The fourth chapter of Dekker’s
<i>Guls Horne-booke</i> is entitled ‘How a Gallant should behaue
himselfe in Powles walkes.’ He bids the gallant make his way
directly into the middle aisle, ‘where, in view of all, you
may publish your suit in what manner you affect most, either
with the slide of your cloake from the one shoulder, and then
you must (as twere in anger) suddenly snatch at the middle
of the inside (if it be taffata at the least) and so by that
meanes your costly lining is betrayd,’ etc. A little later
on (<i>Non-dram. Wks.</i> 2. 238) Dekker speaks of ‘Powles, a
Tennis-court, or a Playhouse’ as a suitable place to ‘publish
your clothes.’ Cf. also <i>Non-dram. Wks.</i> 4. 51.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Overbury gives the following description of ‘a
Phantastique:’ ‘He withers his clothes on a stage as a salesman
is forced to do his suits in Birchin Lane; and when the play
is done, if you mark his rising, ’tis with a kind of walking
epilogue between the two candles, to know if his suit may pass
for current.’ Morley, p. 73.</p>

<p>Stephen Gosson (<i>School of Abuse</i>, p. 29) says that ‘overlashing
in apparel is so common a fault, that the verye hyerlings of
some of our plaiers, which stand at reversion of vi<sup>s</sup> by
the weeke, jet under gentlemens noses in sutes of silke.’</p>

Staple of News</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 5. 151: ‘Yes, on the stage; we are persons
of quality, I assure you, and women of fashion, and come to see
and to be seen.’ <i>Silent Woman</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 3. 409: ‘and come abroad
where the matter is frequent, to court, ... to plays, ...

</div></div>

<p>Gosson has much to say on the subject of women frequenting the
theatre. There, he says (p. 25). ‘everye man and his queane are
first acquainted;’ and he earnestly recommends all women to stay
away from these ‘places of suspition’ (pp. 48 f.).</p>

<p><b>1. 6. 40 Yes, wusse.</b> <i>Wusse</i> is a corruption of <i>wis</i>,
OE. <i>gewis</i>, certainly. Jonson uses the forms <i>I wuss</i>
(<i>Wks.</i> 1. 102), <i>I wusse</i> (<i>Wks.</i> 6. 146), and
<i>Iwisse</i> (<i>Wks.</i> 2. 379. the fol. reading; Gifford changing
to <i>I wiss</i>), in addition to the present form. In some cases the
word is evidently looked upon as a verb.

<p><b>1. 6. 58 sweet Pinnace.</b> Cf. 2. 2. 111 f. A woman is often

<span class="i5"><i>Lord B.</i> Blow off her upper deck.</span>
<span class="i5"><i>Lord L.</i> Tear all her tackle.’</span>
</div></div>

<p>Pinnace, when thus applied to a woman, was almost always used
with a conscious retention of the metaphor. Dekker is especially
fond of the word. <i>Match me in London</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 172:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i28">&mdash;There’s a Pinnace</span>
<span class="i5">(Was mann’d out first by th’ City), is come to th’ Court,</span>

</div></div>

<p>Also Dekker, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 162; 3. 67, 77, 78.</p>

<p>When the word became stereotyped into an equivalent for
procuress or prostitute, the metaphor was often dropped. Thus
in <i>Bart. Fair</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 386: ‘She hath been before me,
punk, pinnace and bawd, any time these two and twenty years.’
Gifford says on this passage: ‘The usual gradation in infamy.
A <i>pinnace</i> was a light vessel built for speed, generally
employed as a tender. Hence our old dramatists constantly used
the word for a person employed in love messages, a go-between
in the worst sense, and only differing from a bawd in not
being stationary.’ A glance at the examples given above will
show, however, that the term was much more elastic than this
explanation would indicate.</p>

<p>The dictionaries give no suggestion of the origin of the metaphor.
I suspect that it may be merely a borrowing from classical usage.
Cf. <i>Menaechmi</i> 2. 3. 442:</p>

<p class="center">Ducit lembum dierectum nauis praedatoria.</p>

<p>In <i>Miles Gloriosus</i> 4. 1. 986, we have precisely the same

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Dr. Bulleyne has often been quoted: ‘Rushes that grow upon dry
groundes be good to strew in halles, chambers and galleries, to
walk upon, defending apparel, as traynes of gownes and kertles
from dust.’ Cf. also <i>Cyn. Rev.</i> 2. 5; <i>Every Man out</i> 3. 3.</p>

<p><b>1. 6. 83 As wise as a Court Parliament.</b> Jonson refers
here, I suppose, to the famous Courts or Parliaments of Love,
which were supposed to have existed during the Middle Ages (cf.
Skeat, <i>Chaucer’s Works</i> 7. lxxx).</p>

<p>Cunningham calls attention to the fact that Massinger’s
<i>Parliament of Love</i> was not produced until 1624. Jonson depicts
a sort of mock Parliament of Love in the <i>New Inn</i>, Act 4.</p>

<p><b>1. 6. 89, 90 as scarce hath soule, In stead of salt.</b>
Whalley refers to <i>Bart. Fair</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 446, 7: ‘Talk of him
to have a soul! ’heart, if he have any more than a thing given
him instead of salt, only to keep him from stinking. I’ll be
hang’d afore my time.’ Gifford quotes the passage from B. &amp; Fl.,
<i>Spanish Curate</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">&mdash;this soul I speake of,</span>
<span class="i5">Or rather salt, to keep this heap of flesh</span>
<span class="i5">From being a walking stench.</span>
</div></div>

<p>W. furnishes a Latin parallel: ‘Sus vero quid habet praeter escam?
cui quidem, ne putresceret, animam ipsam pro sale datam dicit esse
Chrysippus.’&mdash;Cic. <i>De Natura Deor</i>, lib. 2.</p>

<p>It is to these passages that Carlyle refers in his <i>Past and
Present</i>: ‘A certain degree of soul, as Ben Jonson reminds us,
is indispensable to keep the very body from destruction of the
frightfulest sort; to ‘save us,’ says he, ’the expense of salt.’
Bk. 2, Ch. 2.</p>

<p>‘In our and old Jonson’s dialect, man has lost the <i>soul</i> out of
him; and now, after the due period,&mdash;begins to find the want of
it.... Man has lost his soul, and vainly seeks antiseptic salt.’
(Simpson in <i>N. &amp; Q.</i>, 9th Ser. 4. 347, 423.)</p>

<p>To the same Latin source Professor Cook (<i>Mod. Lang. Notes</i>,
Feb., 1905) attributes the passage in <i>Rabbi Ben Ezra</i> 43-45:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">What is he but a brute</span>
<span class="i5">Whose flesh has soul to suit,</span>

</div></div>

<p>and Samuel Johnson’s ‘famous sentence recorded by Boswell under
June 19, 1784: “Talking of the comedy of <i>The Rehearsal</i>, he
said: ‘It has not wit enough to keep it sweet.’”’</p>

<p><b>1. 6. 97 the walks of Lincolnes Inne.</b> One of the famous
Inns of Court (note 3.1.8). It formerly pertained to the Bishops
of Chichester (Stow, <i>Survey</i>, ed. 1633, p. 488a). The gardens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
‘were famous until the erection of the hall, by which they were
curtailed and seriously injured’ (Wh-C.). The Tatler
(May 10, 1709, no. 13) speaks of Lincoln’s Inn Walks.</p>

<p><b><a name="Note_1_6_99"></a>1. 6. 99 I did looke for this geere.</b>
See variants. Cunningham says: ‘In the original it is <i>geere</i>, and
so it ought still to stand. Gear was a word with a most extended
signification. Nares defines it, “matter, subject, or business
in general!” When Jonson uses the word <i>jeer</i> he spells it quite
differently. The <i>Staple of News</i> was first printed at the same
time as the present play, and in the beginning of Act IV. Sc.
<span class="smcap">1</span>, I find: “<i>Fit.</i> Let’s <i>ieere</i> a little.
<i>Pen.</i> Ieere? what’s that?”’</p>

<p>It is so spelt regularly throughout <i>The Staple of News</i>, but in
<i>Ev. Man in</i> 1. 2 (fol. 1616), we find: ‘Such petulant, geering
gamsters that can spare No ... subject from their jest.’ The
fact is that both words were sometimes spelt <i>geere</i>, as well
as in a variety of other ways. The uniform spelling in <i>The
Staple of News</i>, however, seems to indicate that this is the
word <i>gear</i>, which fits the context, fully as well as, perhaps
better than Gifford’s interpretation. A common meaning is ‘talk,
discourse’, often in a depreciatory sense. See Gloss.</p>

the allusion was doubtless more familiar in Jonson’s day than
in our own. The story is retold in Harsnet’s <i>Declaration</i>

the settlement there of the Black or Dominican Friars in 1276.
Sir A. Vandyck lived here 1632-1641. ‘Before Vandyck, however,
Blackfriars was the recognized abode of painters. Cornelius
Jansen (d. 1665) lived in the Blackfriars for several years.

<p><b>1. 7. 25 Your Almanack-Men.</b> An excellent account of the
Almanac-makers of the 17th century is given by H. R. Plomer in
<i>N. &amp; Q.</i>,6th Ser. 12. 243, from which the following is abridged:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Almanac-making had become an extensive and profitable trade
in this country at the beginning of the 17th century, and with
the exception of some fifteen or twenty years at the time of
the Rebellion continued to flourish until its close. There
were three distinct classes of almanacs published during the
seventeenth century&mdash;the common almanacs, which preceded and
followed the period of the Rebellion, and the political and
satirical almanacs that were the direct outcome of that event.</p>

<p>‘The common almanacs came out year after year in unbroken
uniformity. They were generally of octavo size and consisted
of two parts, an almanac and a prognostication. Good and evil
days were recorded, and they contained rules as to bathing,
purging, etc., descriptions of the four seasons and rules to
know the weather, and during the latter half of the century an
astrological prediction and “scheme” of the ensuing year.</p>

<p>‘In the preceding century the makers of almanacs were
“Physitians and Preests”, but they now adopted many other
titles, such as “Student in Astrology”, “Philomath”, “Well
Willer to the Mathematics.” The majority of them were doubtless
astrologers, but not a few were quack doctors, who only
published their almanacs as advertisements.’ (Almanac, a
character in <i>The Staple of News</i>, is described as a
‘doctor in physic.’)</p>

<p>Among the more famous almanac-makers the names of William Lilly,
John Partridge and Bretnor may be mentioned. For the last see
note 2. 1. 1, and B. &amp; Fl., <i>Rollo, Duke of Normandy</i>, where
Fiske and Bretnor appear again. Cf. also <i>Alchemist</i>, <i>Wks.</i>
4. 41; <i>Every Man out</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 39-40; <i>Mag. La.</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 6. 74, 5. In Sir Thomas Overbury’s <i>Character</i> of
<i>The Almanac-Maker</i> (Morley, p. 56) we read: ‘The verses of his
book have a worse pace than ever had Rochester hackney; for his prose,
’tis dappled with ink-horn terms, and may serve for an almanac; but
for his judging at the uncertainty of weather, any old shepherd
shall make a dunce of him.’</p>

<h3>ACT II.</h3>

<p><b>2. 1. 1 Sir, money’s a whore</b>, etc. Coleridge, <i>Notes</i>,
p. 280. emends: ‘Money, sir, money’s a’, &amp;c. Cunningham, on the
other hand, thinks that ‘the 9-syllable arrangement is quite in
Jonson’s manner, and that it forces an emphasis upon every word
especially effective at the beginning of an act.’ See variants.</p>

<p>Money is again designated as a whore in the <i>Staple of News</i>
4. 1: ‘Saucy Jack, away: Pecunia is a whore.’ In the same
play Pennyboy, the usurer, is called a ‘money-bawd.’ Dekker
(<i>Non-dram. Wks.</i> 2. 137) speaks of keeping a bawdy-house for
Lady Pecunia. The figure is a common one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a name="Note_2_1_3"></a>2. 1. 3 Via.</b> This exclamation is quite common
among the dramatists and is explained by Nares as derived from the Italian
exclamation <i>via!</i> ‘away, on!’ with a quibble on the literal of
L. <i>via</i>, a way. The <i>Century Dictionary</i> agrees substantially
with this derivation. Abundant examples of its use are given by
the authorities quoted, to which may be added <i>Merry Devil of
Edmonton</i> 1. 2. 5, and Marston, <i>Dutch Courtezan</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 20:</p>

<p><b>2. 1. 20 Wood-cock.</b> A cant term for a simpleton or dupe.</p>

<p><b>2. 1. 21 th’ Exchange.</b> This was the first Royal Exchange,
founded by Sir Thomas Gresham in 1566, opened by Queen Elizabeth
in 1570-1, and destroyed in the great fire of 1666 (Wh-C.).
Howes (1631) says that it was ‘plenteously stored with all kinds
of rich wares and fine commodities,’ and Paul Hentzner (p. 40)
speaks of it with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>It was a favorite lounging-place, especially in the evening.
Wheatley quotes Hayman, <i>Quodlibet</i>, 1628, p. 6:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Though little coin thy purseless pockets line,</span>
<span class="i5">Yet with great company thou’rt taken up;</span>
<span class="i5">For often with Duke Humfray thou dost dine,</span>
<span class="i5">And often with Sir Thomas Gresham sup.</span>
</div></div>

<p>‘We are told in <i>London</i> and <i>Country Carbonadoed</i>, 1632,
that at the exchange there were usually more coaches attendant
than at church doors.’ Cf. also <i>Bart. Fair</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 357:
‘I challenge all Cheapside to shew such another: Moor-fields,
Pimlico-path, Or the Exchange, in a summer evening.’ Also <i>Ev.
Man in</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 1. 39.</p>

<p><b>2. 1. 30 do you doubt his eares?</b> Ingine’s
speech is capable of a double interpretation. Pug has already spoken of
the ‘liberal ears’ of his asinine master.</p>

<p><b>2. 1. 41 a string of’s purse.</b> Purses, of course, used to
be hung at the girdle. A thief was called a cut-purse. See the
amusing scene in <i>Bart. Fair</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 5. 406.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p><b>2. 1. 53, 4 at the Pan, Not, at the skirts.</b> ‘<i>Pan</i> is not
easily distinguished from <i>skirt</i>. Both words seem to refer to
the outer parts, or extremities. Possibly Meercraft means&mdash;on a
broader scale, on a more extended front.’&mdash;G.</p>

<p>‘The pan is evidently the deepest part of the swamp, which
continues to hold water when the <i>skirts</i> dry up, like the hole
in the middle of the tray under a joint when roasting, which
collects all the dripping. Meercraft proposed to grapple with
the main difficulty at once.’&mdash;C.</p>

<p>I had already arrived at the same conclusion before reading
Cunningham’s note. The <i>NED.</i> gives: ‘Pan. A hollow or
depression in the ground, esp. one in which water stands.</p>

<p>1594 Plat, <i>Jewell-ho</i> 1. 32 Of all Channels, Pondes, Pooles,
Riuers, and Ditches, and of all other pannes and bottomes
whatsoeuer.’</p>

<p><i>Pan</i>, however, is also an obsolete form of <i>pane</i>, a cloth
or skirt. The use is evidently a quibble. The word <i>pan</i> suggested
to Jonson the word <i>skirt</i>, which he accordingly employed not
unaptly.</p>

<p><b>2. 1. 63 his black bag of papers, there, in Buckram.</b> The
buckram bag was the usual sign of the pettifogger. Cf. Marston,
<i>Malcontent</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 1. 235:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5"><i>Pass.</i> Ay, as a pettifogger by his buckram bag.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Dekker, <i>If this be not a good Play</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 3. 274: ‘We must
all turn pettifoggers and in stead of gilt rapiers, hang buckram
bags at our girdles.’ Nash refers to the same thing in <i>Pierce
Pennilesse</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 17.</p>

<p><b>2. 1. 64 th’ Earledome of Pancridge.</b> Pancridge is a
corruption of Pancras. The Earl of Pancridge was ‘one of the
“Worthies” who annually rode to Mile End, or the Artillery
Ground, in the ridiculous procession called <i>Arthurs Shew</i>’
(G.). Cf. <i>To Inigo Marquis Would-be</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 8. 115:</p>

<p><b>2. 1. 71, 2 Your Borachio Of Spaine.</b> ‘“<i>Borachio</i> (says
Min-shieu) is a bottle commonly of a pigges skin, with the hair

inward, dressed inwardly with rozen, to keep wine or liquor
sweet:”&mdash;Wines preserved in these bottles contract a peculiar
flavour, and are then said <i>to taste of the borachio</i>.’&mdash;G.</p>

<p>Florio says: ‘a boracho, or a bottle made of a goates skin such
as they vse in Spaine.’ The word occurs somewhat frequently
(see <i>NED.</i>) and apparently always with this meaning, or in the
figurative sense of ‘drunkard’. It is evident, however, from
Engine’s question, ‘Of the King’s glouer?’ either that it is
used here in a slightly different sense, or more probably that
Merecraft is relying on Fitzdottrel’s ignorance of the subject.
Spanish leather for wearing apparel was at this time held in
high esteem. See note <a href="#Note_4_4_71">4. 4. 71, 2</a>.</p>

<p><b>2. 1. 83 a Harrington.</b> ‘In 1613, a patent was granted to John
Stanhope, lord Harrington, Treasurer of the Chambers, for the
coinage of royal farthing tokens, of which he seems to have availed
himself with sufficient liberality. Some clamour was excited on the
occasion: but it speedily subsided; for the Star Chamber kept a
watchful eye on the first symptoms of discontent at these pernicious
indulgences. From this nobleman they took the name of Harrington
in common conversation.’&mdash;G.</p>

<p>‘Now (1613) my lord Harrington obtained a patent from the
King for the making of Brasse Farthings, a thing that brought with
it some contempt through lawfull.’&mdash;Sparke, <i>Hist. Narration</i>,
Somer’s <i>Tracts</i> 2. 294.</p>

<p>A reference to this coin is made in <i>Drunken Barnaby’s Journal</i>
in the <i>Oxoniana</i> (quoted by Gifford) and in Sir Henry Wotton’s
Letters (p. 558, quoted by Whalley). Cf. also <i>Mag. La.</i>, <i>Wks.</i>
6. 89: ‘I will note bate you a single Harrington,’ and <i>ibid.</i>,

<p><b>2. 1. 102 muscatell.</b> The grape was usually called
<i>muscat</i>. So in Pepys’ <i>Diary</i>, 1662: ‘He hath also sent each of
us some anchovies, olives and muscatt.’ The wine was variously
written <i>muscatel</i>, <i>muscadel</i>, and <i>muscadine</i>. Muscadine and
eggs are often mentioned together (cf. Text, 2. 2. 95-96; <i>New
Inn</i> 3. 1; Middleton, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 290; 3. 94; and 8. 36), and were
used as an aphrodisiac (Bullen). Nares quotes Minsheu: ‘Vinum
muscatum, quod moschi odorem referat; for the sweetnesse and
smell it resembles muske.’</p>

<p><b>2. 1. 116, 7 the receiu’d heresie, That England beares no
Dukes.</b> ‘I know not when this <i>heresy</i> crept in. There was
apparently some unwillingness to create dukes, as a title of
honour, in the Norman race; probably because the Conqueror
and his immediate successors were dukes of Normandy, and did
not choose that a subject should enjoy similar dignities with
themselves. The first of the English who bore the title was
Edward the black prince, (son of Edward III.) who was created
duke of Cornwall, by charter, as Collins says, in 1337. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
dignity being subsequently conferred on several of the
blood-royal, and of the nobility, who came to untimely ends,
an idea seems to have been entertained by the vulgar, that the
title itself was ominous. At the accession of James I. to the
crown of this country, there was, I believe, no English peer of
ducal dignity.’&mdash;G.</p>

<p>The last duke had been created in the reign of Henry VIII., who
made his illegitimate son the Duke of Richmond, and Charles
Brandon, who married his sister Mary, Duke of Suffolk. After the
attainder and execution of Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, in
1572, there was no duke in England except the king’s sons, until the
creation of the Duke of Richmond in 1623.

<p><b><a name="Note_2_1_144"></a>2. 1. 144 Bermudas.</b> ‘This was a cant
term for some places in the town with the same kind of privilege as the mint

<p>‘These <i>streights</i> consisted of a nest of obscure courts,
alleys, and avenues, running between the bottom of St. Martin’s
Lane, Half-moon, and Chandos-street. In Justice Overdo’s time,
they were the receptacles of fraudulent debtors, thieves and
prostitutes.’&mdash;G. (Note on <i>Bart. Fair</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 407.)</p>

<p>‘On Wednesday at the Bermudas Court, Sir Edwin Sandys fell foul
of the Earl of Warwick. The Lord Cavendish seconded Sandys and
the Earl told the Lord, “By his favour he believed he lied.”
Hereupon, it is said, they rode out yesterday, and, as it is
thought, gone beyond sea to fight.&mdash;<i>Leigh to Rev. Joseph Mede</i>,
July 18, 1623.’ (Quoted Wh-C. 1. 169.) So in <i>Underwoods</i>,

known as Greek work, and made by the nuns of Italy in the
twelfth century. It was introduced into England during the
reign of Queen Elizabeth, and continued in fashion during those
of James I. and Charles I. Later it fell under the ban of the
Puritans, and after that period is rarely heard of. (Abridged

<p><b><a name="Note_2_2_49"></a>2. 2. 49, 50 Though they take Master Fitz-dottrell,
I am no such foule.</b> Gifford points out that the punning allusion of
<i>foul</i> to <i>fowl</i> is a play upon the word dottrel. ‘The dotterel
(Fuller tells us) is avis γελοτοποιος a mirth-making bird,
so ridiculously mimical, that he is easily caught, or rather
catcheth himself by his over-active imitation. As the fowler
stretcheth forth his arms and legs, stalking towards the bird,
so the bird extendeth his legs and wings, approaching the fowler
till he is surprised in the net.’&mdash;G.</p>

<p>This is what is alluded to in 4. 6. 42. The use of the metaphor
is common. Gifford quotes Beaumont &amp; Fletcher. <i>Bonduca</i> and
<i>Sea Voyage</i>. Many examples are given in Nares and the <i>NED.</i>,
to which may be added <i>Damon and Pithias</i>, <i>O. Pl.</i> 4. 68; Nash,
<i>Wks.</i> 3. 171; and Butler’s <i>Character of a Fantastic</i> (ed.
Morley, p. 401): ‘He alters his gait with the times, and has not
a motion of his body that (like a dottrel) he does not borrow
from somebody else.’ Nares quotes <i>Old Couple</i>
(<i>O. Pl.</i>, 4th ed., 12. 41):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5"><i>E.</i> Our Dotterel then is caught?</span>
<span class="i21"><i>B.</i> He is and just</span>
<span class="i5">As Dotterels use to be: the lady first</span>
<span class="i5">Advanc’d toward him, stretch’d forth her wing, and he</span>
<span class="i5">Met her with all expressions.</span>
</div></div>

<p>It is uncertain whether the sense of ‘bird’ or ‘simpleton’ is
the original. <i>Dottrel</i> seems to be connected with <i>dote</i> and
<i>dotard</i>. The bird is a species of plover, and Cunningham says
that ‘Selby ridicules the notion of its being more stupid than
other birds.’ In <i>Bart. Fair</i> (<i>Wks.</i> 4. 445) we hear of the
‘sport call’d Dorring the Dotterel.’</p>

a nupson now.’ In <i>Lingua</i>, 1607, (<i>O. Pl.</i>, 4th ed., 9. 367,
458) both the forms <i>nup</i> and <i>nupson</i> are used. The etymology
is uncertain. The <i>Century Dictionary</i> thinks <i>nup</i> may be a
variety of <i>nope</i>. Gifford thinks it may be a corruption of Greek νηπ.</p>

<p><b><a name="Note_2_2_123"></a>2. 2. 123 Picardill.</b> Cotgrave gives:
‘Piccadilles: Piccadilles; the severall divisions or peeces fastened together
about the brimme of the collar of a doublet, &amp;c.’ Gifford
says: ‘With respect to the <i>Piccadil</i>, or, as Jonson writes
it, Picardil, (as if he supposed the fashion of wearing it be
derived from Picardy,) the term is simply a diminutive of picca
(Span. and Ital.) a spear-head, and was given to this article
of foppery, from a fancied resemblance of its stiffened plaits
to the bristled points of those weapons. Blount thinks, and
apparently with justice, that Piccadilly took its name from the
sale of the “small stiff collars, so called”, which was first
set on foot in a house near the western extremity of the present
street, by one Higgins, a tailor.’</p>

<p>As Gifford points out, ‘Pug is affecting modesty, since he had
not only assumed a handsome body, but a fashionable dress, “made
new” for a particular occasion.’ See 5. 1. 35, 36.</p>

<p><b>2. 3. 49 Crowland.</b> Crowland, or Croyland is an ancient town
and parish of Lincolnshire, situated in a low flat district, about eight
miles north-east from Peterborough. The origin of Crowland was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
in a hermitage founded in the 7th century by St. Guthlac. An abbey
was founded in 714 by King Ethelbald, which was twice burnt and
restored.</p>

<p><b>2. 4. 6 Spenser, I thinke, the younger.</b> Thomas (1373-1400)
was the only member of the Despenser family who was an Earl of
Gloucester. The person referred to here, however, is Hugh le
Despenser, the younger baron, son of Hugh le Despenser, the elder.
He married Eleanor, daughter of Gilbert of Clare, Earl of Gloucester,
and sister and coheiress of the next Earl Gilbert. After the
death of the latter, the inheritance was divided between the husbands
of his three sisters, and Despenser was accordingly sometimes called
Earl of Gloucester.</p>

<p>Despenser was at first on the side of the barons, but later joined
the King’s party. In 1321 a league was formed against him, and he
was banished, but was recalled in the following year. In the
Barons’ rising of 1326 he was taken prisoner, brought to Hereford,
tried and put to death.</p>

<p><b>2. 4. 8 Thomas of Woodstocke.</b> Thomas of Woodstock, Earl
of Buckingham (1355-97), the youngest son of Edward III., was
made Duke of Gloucester by his nephew, Richard II., in 1385, and
later acquired an extraordinary influence, dominating the affairs of
England for several years. By his high-handed actions he incurred
Richard’s enmity. He was arrested July 10, 1397, and conveyed to
Calais, where he was murdered in the following September by the
king’s order.</p>

<p><b>2. 4. 10 Duke Humphrey.</b> Humphrey, called the Good Duke
Humphrey (1391-1447), youngest son of Henry IV., was created
Duke of Gloucester and Earl of Pembroke in 1414. During the
minority of Henry VI. he acted as Protector of the kingdom. His
career was similar to that of Thomas of Woodstock. In 1447 he
was arrested at Bury by order of Henry VI., who had become king
in 1429. Here he died in February, probably by a natural death,
although there were suspicions of foul play.</p>

<p><b>2. 4. 11 Richard the Third.</b> Richard III. (1452-1485), Duke of
Gloucester and King of England, was defeated and slain in the battle
of Bosworth Field, 1485.</p>

<p><b>2. 4. 12-4 MER. By ... authentique.</b> This passage has been
the occasion of considerable discussion. The subject was first
approached by Malone. In a note to an essay on <i>The Order of
Shakespeare’s Plays</i> in his edition of Shakespeare’s works (ed.
1790, 3. 322) he says: ‘In <i>The Devil’s an Ass</i>, acted in 1616,
all his historical plays are obliquely censured.’</p>

<p>Again in a dissertation on <i>Henry VI.</i>: ‘The malignant Ben, does
indeed, in his <i>Devil’s an Ass</i>, 1616, sneer at our author’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
historical pieces, which for twenty years preceding had been in high reputation,
and probably were <i>then</i> the only historical dramas that had possession
of the theatre; but from the list above given, it is clear that
Shakespeare was not the <i>first</i> who dramatized our old chronicles;
and that the principal events of English History were familiar to
the ears of his audience, before he commenced a writer for the
stage.’ Malone here refers to quotations taken from Gosson and
Lodge. Both these essays were reprinted in Steevens’ edition, and
Malone’s statements were repeated in the edition by Dr. Chalmers.</p>

<p>In 1808 appeared Gilchrist’s essay, <i>An Examination of the
Charges ... of Ben Jonson’s enmity,</i> etc. <i>towards Shakespeare</i>.
This refutation, strengthened by Gifford’s <i>Proofs of Ben
Jonson’s Malignity</i>, has generally been deemed conclusive.
Gifford’s note on the present passage is written with much
asperity. He was not content, however, with an accurate
restatement of Malone’s arguments. He changes the italics in
order to produce an erroneous impression, printing thus: ‘which
were probably then the <i>only historical dramas on the stage</i>:
He adds: ‘And this is advanced in the very face of his own
arguments, to prove that there were scores, perhaps hundreds, of
others on it at the time.’ This is direct falsification. There
is no contradiction in Malone’s arguments. What he attempted
to prove was that Shakespeare had had predecessors in this
field, but that in 1616 his plays held undisputed possession
of the stage. Gifford adds a passage from Heywood’s <i>Apology
for Actors</i>, 1612, which is more to the point: ‘Plays have
taught the unlearned the knowledge of many famous <i>histories</i>,
instructed such as cannot read in the discovery of our <i>English
Chronicles</i>: and what man have you now of that weake capacity
that being possest of their true use, cannot discourse of any
notable thing recorded even from <i>William the Conqueror</i>, until
this day?’</p>

<p>This passage seems to point to the existence of other historical
plays <i>contemporary</i> with those of Shakespeare. Besides, Jonson’s
words seem sufficiently harmless. Nevertheless, although I am not
inclined to accept Malone’s charge of ‘malignity’, I cannot agree
with Gifford that the reference is merely a general one. I have no
doubt that the ‘Chronicle,’ of which Merecraft speaks, is Hall’s,
and the passage the following: ‘It semeth to many men, that the
name and title of Gloucester, hath been vnfortunate and vnluckie
to diuerse, whiche for their honor, haue been erected by creacion of
princes, to that stile and dignitie, as Hugh Spencer, Thomas of
Woodstocke, sonne to kyng Edward the third, and this duke Humfrey,
which thre persones, by miserable death finished their daies,
and after them kyng Richard the iii. also, duke of Gloucester, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
ciuill warre was slaine and confounded: so y<sup>t</sup> this name of
Gloucester, is take for an vnhappie and vnfortunate stile, as
the prouerbe speaketh of Seianes horse, whose rider was euer
unhorsed, and whose possessor was euer brought to miserie.’
Hall’s <i>Chronicle</i>, ed. 1809, pp. 209-10. The passage in ‘the
Play-bookes’ which Jonson satirizes is at the close of
<i>3 Henry VI.</i> 2. 6:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7"><i>Edw.</i> Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,</span>
<span class="i5">And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,</span>
<span class="i5">Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.</span>
<span class="i7"><i>Rich.</i> Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;</span>
<span class="i5">For Gloucester’s dukedom is too ominous.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The last line, of course, corresponds to the <i>’Tis fatal</i> of
Fitzdottrel. Furthermore it may be observed that Thomas of
Woodstock’s death at Calais is referred to in Shakespeare’s <i>K.
Rich. II.</i>; Duke Humphrey appears in <i>2 Henry IV.</i>; <i>Henry V.</i>;
and <i>1</i> and <i>2 Henry VI.</i>; and Richard III. in <i>2</i> and <i>3 Henry
VI.</i> and <i>K. Rich. III.</i> <i>3 Henry VI.</i> is probably, however, not
of Shakespearean authorship.</p>

<p><b>2. 4. 23 Groen-land.</b> The interest in Greenland must have been
at its height in 1616. Between 1576 and 1622 English explorers
discovered various portions of its coast; the voyages of Frobisher,
Davis, Hudson and Baffin all taking place during that period.
Hakluyt’s <i>Principall Navigations</i> appeared in 1589, Davis’s <i>Worldes
Hydrographical Description</i> in 1594, and descriptions of Hudson’s
voyages in 1612-3. The usual spelling of the name seems to have
been <i>Groenland</i>, as here. I find the word spelled also <i>Groineland</i>,
<i>Groenlandia</i>, <i>Gronland</i>, and <i>Greneland</i> (see Publications of the
Hakluyt Society). Jonson’s reference has in it a touch of sarcasm.</p>

<p><b>2. 5. 10 And garters which are lost, if shee can shew
’hem.</b> Gifford thinks the line should read: ‘can not shew’.
Cunningham gives a satisfactory explanation: ‘As I understand
this it means that if a gallant once saw the garters he would
never rest until he obtained possession of them, and they would
thus be <i>lost</i> to the family. Garters thus begged from the
ladies were used by the gallants as <i>hangers</i> for their swords
and poniards. See <i>Every Man out of his Humour</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 81:
“O, I have been graced by them beyond all aim of affection: this
is her garter my dagger hangs in;” and again p. 194. We read
also in <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 266, of a gallant whose
devotion to a lady in such that he</p>

<span class="i5"><i>Will spend his patrimony for a garter</i>,</span>
<span class="i5">Or the least feather in her bounteous fan.’</span>
</div></div>

<p>Gifford’s theory that ladies had some mode of displaying their
garters is contradicted by the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5"><i>Mary.</i> These roses will shew rare: would ’twere in fashion</span>
<span class="i5">That the garters might be seen too!</span>

<i>Anat.</i>, Part 1, P. 79.</p>

<p><b>2. 6. 21 and done the worst defeate vpon my selfe.</b>
<i>Defeat</i> is often used by Shakespeare in this sense. See
Schmidt, and compare <i>Hamlet</i> 2. 2. 598:</p>

<p><b>2. 6. 37 SN.</b> ‘Whoever has noticed the narrow streets or
rather lanes of our ancestors, and observed how story projected
beyond story, till the windows of the upper rooms almost touched
on different sides, will easily conceive the feasibility of
everything which takes place between Wittipol and his mistress,
though they make their appearance in different houses.’&mdash;G.</p>

<p>I cannot believe that Jonson wished to represent the two houses
as on opposite sides of the street. He speaks of them as
‘contiguous’, which would naturally mean side by side. Further
than this, one can hardly imagine even in the ‘narrow lanes of
our ancestors’ so close a meeting that the liberties mentioned
in 2. 6. 76 SN. could be taken.</p>

<p><b><a name="Note_2_6_53"></a>2. 6. 53 A strange woman.</b> In <i>Bart. Fair</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 4. 395, Justice Overdo says: ‘Rescue this youth here out of the hands
of the lewd man and <i>the strange woman</i>.’ Gifford explains in a
note: ‘The scripture phrase for an immodest woman, a prostitute.
Indeed this acceptation of the word is familiar to many
languages. It is found in the Greek; and we have in Terence&mdash;pro
<i>uxore habere hanc</i> peregrinam: upon which Donatus remarks, <i>hoc
nomine etiam</i> meretrices <i>nominabantur</i>.’</p>

<p>The same sort of familiarity is hinted at in Stubbes, <i>Anatomy

(Simpson’s <i>School of Shak.</i> 2. 50) and <i>Vindication of Top

naked paps, the Devils ginnes.’ Cf. also <i>Cyn. Rev.</i>, <i>Wks.</i>
2. 266, and <i>Case is A.</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 6. 330. It seems to have been
a favorite subject of attack at the hands of both Puritans and dramatists.</p>

the snow, and the swan’s down have already been used in <i>The

Martial, <i>Epig.</i> 1. 115:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>In this place Jonson seems to have more particularly in mind <i>Epig.</i> 5. 37:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Puella senibus dulcior mibi cygnis ...</span>

<p><b>2. 7. 2, 3 that Wit of man will doe’t.</b> There is evidently
an ellipsis of some sort before <i>that</i> (cf. Abbott, §284).
Perhaps ‘provided’ is to be understood.</p>

<p><b>2. 7. 4 She shall no more be buz’d at.</b> The metaphor is
carried out in the words that follow, <i>sweet meates</i> 5, <i>hum</i>
6, <i>flye-blowne</i> 7. ‘Fly-blown’ was a rather common term of
opprobrium. Cf. Dekker, <i>Satiromastix</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 1. 195: ‘Shal
distaste euery vnsalted line, in their fly-blowne Comedies.’
Jonson is very fond of this metaphor, and presses it beyond all
endurance in <i>New Inn</i>, Act 2. Sc. 2, <i>Wks.</i> 5. 344, 5, etc.</p>

<p><b>2. 7. 13 I am resolu’d on’t, Sir.</b> See variants. Gifford
points out the quibble on the word <i>resolved</i>. See Gloss.</p>

<p><b>2. 7. 17 O! I could shoote mine eyes at him.</b> Cf. <i>Fox</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 3. 305: ‘That I could shoot mine eyes at him, like
gun-stones!’</p>

<p><b>2. 7. 22.</b> See variants. The <i>the</i> is probably absorbed by
the preceding dental. Cf. 5. 7. 9.</p>

<p><b>2. 7. 33 fine pac’d huishers.</b> See note <a href="#Note_4_4_201">4. 4. 201</a>.</p>

<p><b>2. 7. 38 turn’d my good affection.</b> ‘Not diverted or
changed its course; but, as appears from what follows, soured
it. The word is used in a similar sense by Shakespeare:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Has friendship such a faint and <i>milky</i> heart,</span>
<span class="i5">It turns in less than two nights!</span>
<span class="i30"><i>Timon</i>, 3. 2.’&mdash;G.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>2. 8. 9, 10 That was your bed-fellow.</b> Ingine, perhaps
in anticipation of Fitzdottrel’s advancement, employs a term
usually applied to the nobility. Cf. <i>K. Henry V.</i> 2. 2. 8:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,</span>
<span class="i5">Whom he had cloy’d and grac’d with princely favors.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Steevens in a note on the passage points out that the familiar
appellation of <i>bedfellow</i>, which appears strange to us, was
common among the ancient nobility.’ He quotes from <i>A Knack

<p><b>2. 8. 64 Dicke Robinson.</b> Collier says: ‘This player may have
been an original actor in some of Shakespeare’s later dramas, and
he just outlived the complete and final suppression of the stage.’
His death and the date at which it occurred have been matters of dispute.</p>

<p>His earliest appearance in any list of actors is at the end of
Jonson’s <i>Catiline</i>, 1611, with the King’s Majesty’s Servants.
He was probably the youngest member of the company, and
doubtless sustained a female part. Gifford believes that he took
the part of Wittipol in the present play, though this is merely
a conjecture. ‘The only female character he is known to have
filled is the lady of Giovanus in <i>The Second Maiden’s Tragedy</i>,
but at what date is uncertain; neither do we know at what period
he began to represent male characters.’ Of the plays in which
he acted, Collier mentions Beaumont and Fletcher’s <i>Bonduca</i>,
<i>Double Marriage</i>, <i>Wife for a Month</i>, and <i>Wild Goose Chase</i>
(1621); and Webster’s <i>Duchess of Malfi</i>, 1622.</p>

<p>His name is found in the patent granted by James I. in 1619 and
in that granted by Charles I. in 1625. Between 1629 and 1647 no
notice of him occurs, and this is the last date at which we hear of
him. ‘His name follows that of Lowin in the dedication to the folio
of Beaumont and Fletcher’s works, published at that time.’&mdash;Collier,
<i>Memoirs</i>, p. 268.</p>

<p>Jonson not infrequently refers to contemporary actors. Compare
the <i>Epitaph on Salathiel Pavy</i>, <i>Ep.</i> 120; the speech of Venus
in <i>The Masque of Christmas</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 7. 263; and the reference
to Field and Burbage in <i>Bart. Fair</i> 5. 3.</p>

<p><b>2. 8. 73 send frolicks!</b> ‘<i>Frolics</i> are couplets, commonly
of an amatory or satirical nature, written on small slips of paper,
and wrapt round a sweetmeat. A dish of them is usually placed on the
table after supper, and the guests amuse themselves with sending them
to one another, as circumstances seem to render them appropriate:
this is occasionally productive of much mirth. I do not believe that
the game is to be found in England; though the drawing on Twelfth
Night may be thought to bear some kind of coarse resemblance to it.
On the continent I have frequently been present at it.’&mdash;G.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>NED.</i> gives only one more example, from R. H. <i>Arraignm.</i>
<i>Whole Creature XIV.</i> § 2. 244 (1631) ‘Moveable as Shittlecockes
... or as Frolicks at Feasts, sent from man to man, returning
againe at last, to the first man.’</p>

<p><b>2. 8. 102 your bond Of Sixe; and Statute of eight
hundred!</b> I. e., of six, and eight hundred pounds. ‘Statutes
merchant, statutes staple, and recognizances in the nature of
a statute staple were acknowledgements of debt made in writing
before officers appointed for that purpose, and enrolled of
record. They bound the lands of the debtor; and execution
was awarded upon them upon default in payment without the
ordinary process of an action. These securities were originally
introduced for the encouragement of trade, by providing a sure
and speedy remedy for the recovery of debts between merchants,
and afterwards became common assurances, but have now become
obsolete.’&mdash;S. M. Leake, <i>Law of Contracts</i>, p. 95.</p>

<p>Two of Pecunia’s attendants in <i>The Staple of News</i> are
<i>Statute</i> and <i>Band</i> (i. e. Bond, see <i>U.</i> 34).
The two words are often mentioned together. In Dekker’s
<i>Bankrouts Banquet</i> (<i>Non-dram. Wks.</i> 3. 371)
statutes are served up to the bankrupts.</p>

<p>Trains is evidently trying to impress Fitzdottrel with the
importance of Merecraft’s transactions.</p>

<p><b><a name="Note_3_1_8"></a>3. 1. 8 Innes of Court.</b> ‘The four Inns
of Court, Gray’s Inn, Lincoln’s Inn, the Inner, and the Middle Temple, have
alone the right of admitting persons to practise as barristers, and
that rank can only be attained by keeping the requisite number
of terms as a student at one of those Inns.’&mdash;Wh-C.</p>

<p>Jonson dedicates <i>Every Man out of his Humor</i> ‘To the Noblest
Nurseries of Humanity and Liberty in the Kingdom, the Inns of Court.’</p>

<p><b>3. 1. 10 a good man.</b> Gifford quotes <i>Merch. of Ven.</i>
1. 3. 15: ‘My meaning in saying he is a good man, is, to have
you understand me, that he is sufficient.’ Marston, <i>Dutch
Courtesan</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 57. uses the word in the same sense.

<p><b><a name="Note_3_1_20"></a>3. 1. 20 our two Pounds, the Compters.</b>
The London Compters or Counters were two sheriff’s prisons for debtors,
etc., mentioned as early as the 15th century. In Jonson’s day
they were the Poultry Counter and the Wood Street Counter. They
were long a standing joke with the dramatists, who seem to
speak from a personal acquaintance with them. Dekker (<i>Roaring
Girle</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 3. 189) speaks of ‘Wood Street College,’ and
Middleton (<i>Phoenix</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 1. 192) calls them ‘two most famous
universities’ and in another place ‘the two city hazards,
Poultry and Wood Street.’ Jonson in <i>Every Man in</i> (<i>Wks.</i> 1.
42) speaks of them again as ‘your city pounds, the counters’,
and in <i>Every man out</i> refers to the ‘Master’s side’ (<i>Wks</i>. 2.
181) and the ‘two-penny ward,’ the designations for the cheaper
quarters of the prison.</p>

<p><b>3. 1. 35 out of rerum natura.</b> <i>In rerum natura</i> is a
phrase used by Lucretius 1. 25. It means, according to the
<i>Stanford Dictionary</i>, ‘in the nature of things, in the physical
universe.’ In some cases it is practically equivalent to ‘in
existence.’ Cf. <i>Sil. Wom.</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 3. 382: ‘Is the bull, bear,
and horse, in <i>rerum natura</i> still?’</p>

<p><b>3. 2. 12 a long vacation.</b> The long vacation in the Inns
of Court, which Jonson had in mind, lasts from Aug. 13 to Oct.
23. In <i>Staple of News</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 5. 170, he makes a similar
thrust at the shop-keepers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><b>3. 2. 22 I bought Plutarch’s liues.</b> T. North’s famous
translation first appeared in 1579. New editions followed in
1595, 1603, 1610-12, and 1631.</p>

<p><b>3. 2. 33 Buy him a Captaines place.</b> The City Train Bands
were a constant subject of ridicule for the dramatists. They are
especially well caricatured by Fletcher in <i>The Knight of the
Burning Pestle</i>, Act 5. In addition to the City Train Bands,
the Fraternity of Artillery, now called The Honorable Artillery
Company, formed a separate organization. The place of practice
was the Artillery Garden in Bunhill Fields (see note <a href="#Note_3_2_41">3. 2. 41</a>).
In spite of ridicule the Train Bands proved a source of strength
during the Civil War (see Clarendon, <i>Hist. of the Rebellion</i>,
ed. 1826, 4. 236 and Wh-C., <i>Artillery Ground</i>).</p>

<p>Jonson was fond of poking fun at the Train Bands. Cf. <i>U.</i> 62,
<i>Wks.</i> 8. 409; <i>Ev. Man in</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 1. 88; and <i>Alchemist</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 4. 13. Face, it will be remembered, had been ‘translated
suburb-captain’ through Subtle’s influence.</p>

<p>The immediate occasion of Jonson’s satire was doubtless the
revival of military enthusiasm in 1614, of which Entick
(<i>Survey</i> 2. 115) gives the following account:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>‘The military genius of the <i>Londoners</i> met with an opportunity,
about this time, to convince the world that they still retained the
spirit of their forefathers, should they be called out in the cause of
their king and country. His majesty having commanded a general
muster of the militia throughout the kingdom, the city of <i>London</i>
not only mustered 6000 citizens completely armed, who performed
their several evolutions with surprizing dexterity; but a martial
spirit appeared amongst the rising generation. The children endeavoured
to imitate their parents; chose officers, formed themselves
into companies, marched often into the fields with colours flying and
beat of drums, and there, by frequent practice, grew up expert in
the military exercises.’</p>

<p><b>3. 2. 35 Cheapside.</b> Originally Cheap, or West Cheap, a street
between the Poultry and St. Paul’s, a portion of the line from
Charing Cross to the Royal Exchange, and from Holborn to the
Bank of England.</p>

<p>‘At the west end of this Poultrie and also of Buckles bury, beginneth
the large street of West Cheaping, a market-place so called,
which street stretcheth west till ye come to the little conduit by
Paule’s Gate.’&mdash;Stow, ed. Thoms, p. 99.</p>

<p>The glory of Cheapside was Goldsmith’s Row (see note <a href="#Note_3_5_2">3. 5. 2</a>).
It was also famous in early times for its ‘Ridings,’ and during
Jonson’s period for its ‘Cross,’ its ‘Conduit,’ and its ‘Standard’
(see note <a href="#Note_1_1_56">1. 1. 56</a> and Wh&mdash;C.).</p>

<p><b>3. 2. 35 Scarfes.</b> ‘Much worn by knights and military
officers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.’&mdash;Planché.</p>

<p><b>3. 2. 35 Cornehill.</b> Cornhill, between the Poultry
and Leadenhall Street, an important portion of the greatest
thoroughfare in the world, was, says Stow, ‘so called of a
corn market time out of mind there holden.’ In later years it
was provided with a pillory and stocks, a prison, called the
Tun, for street offenders, a conduit of ‘sweet water’, and a
standard. See Wh-C.</p>

<p><b><a name="Note_3_2_38"></a>3. 2. 38 the posture booke.</b> A book
descriptive of military evolutions, etc. H. Peacham’s <i>Compleat Gentleman</i>,
1627 (p. 300, quoted by Wheatley, <i>Ev. Mall in</i>), gives a long
list of ‘Postures of the Musquet’ and G. Markham’s <i>Souldier’s
Accidence</i> gives another. Cf. <i>Tale Tub</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 6. 218:</p>

<p><b><a name="Note_3_2_41"></a>3. 2. 41 Finsbury.</b> In 1498, ‘certain
grounds, consisting of gardens, orchards, &amp;c. on the north side of
<i>Chiswell-street</i>, and called <i>Bunhill</i> or <i>Bunhill-fields</i>,
within the manor of <i>Finsbury</i>, were by the mayor and commonalty
of <i>London</i>, converted into a large field, containing 11 acres,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and 11 perches, now known by the name of the <i>Artillery-ground</i>,
for their train-bands, archers, and other military citizens, to
exercise in.’&mdash;Entick, <i>Survey</i> 1. 441.</p>

<p>In 1610 the place had become neglected, whereupon commissioners
were appointed to reduce it ‘into such order and state for the
archers as they were in the beginning of the reign of King Henry
VIII.’ (<i>Ibid.</i> 2. 109). See also Stow, <i>Survey</i>, ed. Thoms, p. 159.</p>

<p>Dekker (<i>Shomaker’s Holiday</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 1. 29) speaks of being
‘turnd to a Turk, and set in Finsburie for boyes to shoot at’,
and Nash (<i>Pierce Pennilesse</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 128) and Jonson (<i>Bart.
Fair</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 507) make precisely similar references. Master
Stephen in <i>Every Man in</i> (<i>Wks.</i> 1. 10) objects to keeping
company with the ‘archers of Finsbury.’ Cf. also the elaborate
satire in <i>U.</i> 62, (<i>Wks.</i> 8. 409).</p>

<p><b>3. 3. 25 Godwit.</b> The godwit was formerly in great repute
as a table delicacy. Thomas Muffett in <i>Health’s Improvement</i>,
p. 99, says: ‘A fat godwit is so fine and light meat, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
noblemen (yea, and merchants too, by your leave) stick not to
buy them at four nobles a dozen.’</p>

<p>Cf. also Sir T. Browne, <i>Norf. Birds</i>, <i>Wks.</i>, 1835, 4. 319:
God-wyts ... accounted the daintiest dish in England; and, I
think, for the bigness of the biggest price.’ Jonson mentions
the godwit in this connection twice in the <i>Sil. Wom.</i> (<i>Wks.</i>
3. 350 and 388), and in Horace, <i>Praises of a Country Life</i>
(<i>Wks.</i> 9. 121) translates ‘attagen Ionicus’ by ‘Ionian godwit.’</p>

<p><b>3. 3. 26 The Globes, and Mermaides!</b> Theatres and taverns.
Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps has proved that the Globe Theatre on the
Bankside, Southwark, the summer theatre of Shakespeare and his
fellows, was built in 1599. It was erected from materials brought
by Richard Burbage and Peter Street from the theatre in Shoreditch.
On June 29, 1613, it was destroyed by fire, but was rebuilt without
delay in a superior style, and this time with a roof of tile, King
James contributing to the cost. Chamberlaine, writing to Alice
Carleton (June 30, 1614), calls the Globe Playhouse ‘the fairest in
England.’ It was pulled down Apr. 15, 1644.</p>

<p>Only the Lord Chamberlain’s Company (the King’s Men) seems to
have acted here. It was the scene of several of Shakespeare’s
plays and two of Jonson’s, <i>Every Man out</i> and <i>Every Man in</i>
(Halliwell-Phillips, <i>Illustrations</i>, p. 43). The term ‘summer
theatre’ is applicable only to the rebuilt theatre (<i>ibid.</i>, p.
44). In <i>Ev. Man out</i> (quarto, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 196) Johnson refers to
‘this fair-fitted <i>Globe</i>’, and in the <i>Execration upon Vulcan</i>
(<i>Wks.</i> 8. 404) to the burning of the ‘Globe, the glory of the
Bank.’ In <i>Poetaster</i> (<i>Wks.</i> 2. 430) he uses the word again
as a generic term: ‘your Globes, and your Triumphs.’</p>

<p>There seem to have been two Mermaid Taverns, one of which stood
in Bread Street with passage entrances from Cheapside and Friday
Street, and the other in Cornhill. They are often referred to
by the dramatists. Cf. the famous lines written by <i>Francis
Beaumont to Ben Jonson</i>, B. &amp; Fl., <i>Wks.</i>, ed. 1883, 2. 708;
<i>City Match</i>, <i>O. Pl.</i> 9. 334, etc. Jonson often mentions
the Mermaid. Cf. <i>Inviting a Friend</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 8. 205:</p>

<p><b>3. 3. 69 the roaring manner.</b> Gifford defines it as the ‘language
of bullies affecting a quarrel’ (<i>Wks.</i> 4. 483). The ‘Roaring Boy’
continued under various designations to infest the streets of London
from the reign of Elizabeth until the beginning of the eighteenth
century. Spark (Somer’s <i>Tracts</i> 2. 266) says that they were persons
prodigall and of great expence, who having runne themselves
into debt, were constrained to run into factions to defend themselves
from danger of the law.’ He adds that divers of the nobility
afforded them maintenance, in return for which ‘they entered into
many desperate enterprises.’</p>

<p>Arthur Wilson (<i>Life of King James I.</i>, p. 28), writing of the
disorderly state of the city in 1604, says: ‘Divers <i>Sects</i> of
<i>vitious Persons</i> going under the Title of <i>Roaring Boyes</i>,
<i>Bravadoes</i>, <i>Roysters</i>, &amp;c. commit many insolences; the Streets
swarm night and day with bloody quarrels, private <i>Duels</i>
fomented,’ etc.</p>

<p>Kastril, the ‘angry boy’ in the <i>Alchemist</i>, and Val Cutting and
Knockem in <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> are roarers, and we hear of them
under the title of ‘terrible boys’ in the <i>Silent Woman</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
(<i>Wks.</i> 3. 349). Cf. also Sir Thomas Overbury’s <i>Character of a

Hill in 1810, the work of coinage was carried on in the Tower of
London. Up to 1640, when banking arose, merchants were in the
habit of depositing their bullion and cash in the Tower Mint, under
guardianship of the Crown (see Wh-C. under <i>Royal Mint</i>, and
<i>History of Banking in all the Leading Nations</i>, London, 1896, 2. 1).</p>

<p><b>3. 3. 86-8 let ... hazard.</b> Merecraft seems to mean: ‘You
are in no hurry. Pray therefore allow me to defer your business
until I have brought opportune aid to this gentleman’s distresses at
a time when his fortunes are in a hazardous condition.’ The pregnant
use of the verb <i>timing</i> and the unusual use of the word <i>terms</i>
for a period of time render the meaning peculiarly difficult.</p>

<p><b>3. 3. 106 a Businesse.</b> This was recognized as the technical
expression. Sir Thomas Overbury ridicules it in his <i>Characters</i>,
ed. Morley, p. 72: ‘If any private quarrel happen among our great
courtiers, he (the Roaring Boy) proclaims the business&mdash;that’s the
word, the business&mdash;as if the united force of the Roman Catholics
were making up for Germany.’ Jonson ridicules the use of the
word in similar fashion in the Masque of <i>Mercury Vindicated from
the Alchemists</i>.</p>

<p><b>3. 3. 133 hauings.</b> Jonson uses the expression again in <i>Ev. Man
in</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 1. 29, and <i>Gipsies Met.</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 7. 364. It
is also used in <i>Muse’s Looking Glasse</i>, <i>O. Pl.</i> 9. 175.</p>

<p><b>3. 3. 155 You shall ha’ twenty pound on’t.</b> As Commission on
the two hundred. ‘Ten in the hundred’ was the customary rate at
this period (see <i>Staple of News</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 5. 189).</p>

<p><b>3. 3. 165 St. Georges-tide?</b> From a very early period the 23d
of April was dedicated to St. George. From the time of Henry V.
The festival had been observed with great splendor at Windsor and
other towns, and bonfires were built (see Shak, <i>1 Henry VI.</i> 1. 1).
The festival continued to be celebrated until 1567, when Elizabeth
ordered its discontinuance. James I., however, kept the 23d of April
to some extent, and the revival of the feast in all its glories was
only prevented by the Civil War. So late as 1614 it was the custom
for fashionable gentlemen to wear blue coats on St. George’s Day,
probably in imitation of the blue mantle worn by the Knights of
the Garter, an order created at the feast of St. George in 1344
(see Chambers’ <i>Book of Days</i> 1. 540).</p>

<p>The passages relating to this custom are <i>Ram Alley</i>,
<i>O. Pl.</i>, 2d ed., 5. 486:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">By Dis, I will be knight,</span>
<span class="i5">Wear a blue coat on great St. George’s day,</span>
<span class="i5">And with my fellows drive you all from Paul’s</span>
<span class="i5">For this attempt.</span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Runne and a great Cast</i>, <i>Epigr.</i> 33:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">With’s coram nomine keeping greater sway</span>
<span class="i5">Than a court blew-coat on St. George’s day.</span>
</div></div>

<p>From these passages Nares concludes ‘that some festive ceremony
was carried on at St. Paul’s on St. George’s day annually; that
the court attended; that the <i>blue-coats</i>, or attendants, of the
courtiers, were employed and authorised to keep order, and drive
out refractory persons; and that on this occasion it was proper
for a knight to officiate as <i>blue coat</i> to some personage of
higher rank’.</p>

<p>In the <i>Conversations with Drummond</i>, Jonson’s <i>Wks.</i> 9. 393,
we read: ‘Northampton was his mortal enimie for beating, on a St.
George’s day, one of his attenders.’ Pepys speaks of there being
bonfires in honor of St. George’s Day as late as Apr. 23, 1666.</p>

<p><b>3. 3. 166 chaines? PLV. Of gold, and pearle.</b> The gold
chain was formerly a mark of rank and dignity, and a century
before this it had been forbidden for any one under the degree of
a gentleman of two hundred marks a year to wear one (<i>Statutes
of the Realm</i>, 7 Henry VIII. c. 6). They were worn by the Lord
Mayors (Dekker, <i>Shomaker’s Holiday</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 1. 42), rich
merchants and aldermen (Glapthorne, <i>Wit for a Constable</i>,
<i>Wks.</i>, ed. 1874, 1. 201-3), and later became the distinctive
mark of the upper servant in a great family, especially the
steward (see Nares and <i>Ev. Man out</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 31).
Massinger (<i>City Madam</i>, <i>Wks.</i>, p. 334) speaks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of wearing a chain of gold ‘on solemn days.’ With the present
passage cf. <i>Underwoods</i> 62, <i>Wks.</i> 8. 410:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">If they stay here but till St. George’s day.</span>
<span class="i5">All ensigns of a war are not yet dead,</span>
<span class="i5">Nor marks of wealth so from a nation fled,</span>

<p><b><a name="Note_3_3_170"></a>3. 3. 170 take in Pimlico.</b> ‘Near Hoxton,
a great summer resort in the early part of the 17th century and famed for its
cakes, custards, and Derby ale. The references to the Hoxton
Pimlico are numerous in our old dramatists.’&mdash;Wh&mdash;C. It is
mentioned among other places in <i>Greene’s Tu Quoque, The City
Match</i>, fol. 1639, <i>News from Hogsdon</i>, 1598, and Dekker,
<i>Roaring Girle</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 3. 219, where it is spoken of as
‘that nappy land of spice-cakes.’ In 1609 a tract was published,
called <i>Pimlyco or Runne Red-Cap, ’tis a Mad World at Hogsdon</i>.</p>

<p>Jonson refers to it repeatedly. Cf. <i>Alch.</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 155:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i25">&mdash;Gallants, men and women.</span>
<span class="i5">And of all sorts, tag-rag, been seen to flock here,</span>

<span class="i5">In days of Pimlico and Eye-bright.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Cf. also <i>Alch.</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 151; <i>Bart. Fair</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 4. 357; and this play 4. 4. 164. In <i>Underwoods</i> 62
the same expression is used as in this passage:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">What a strong fort old Pimlico had been!</span>
<span class="i5">How it held out! how, last, ’twas taken in!&mdash;</span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Take in</i> in the sense of ‘capture’ is used again in <i>Every Man
in</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 1. 64, and frequently in Shakespeare (see Schmidt).
The reference here, as Cunningham suggests, is to the Finsbury
sham fights. Hogsden was in the neighborhood of Finsbury, and
the battles were doubtless carried into its territory.</p>

<p>‘Or rather on the Puritans, I think; who were sufficiently
obnoxious to this charge. The Jesuits would be out of place
here.’&mdash;G.</p>

<p>Why the Puritans are any more appropriate Gifford does not
vouchsafe to tell us. So far as I have been able to discover the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Puritans were never called ‘Fathers,’ their regular appellation
being ‘the brethren’ (cf. <i>Alch.</i> and <i>Bart. Fair</i>). The
Puritans were accused of a distortion of Scriptural texts to
suit their own purposes, instances of which occur in the dramas
mentioned above. On the whole, however, equivocation is more
characteristic of the Jesuits. They were completely out of
favor at this time. Under the generalship of Claudio Acquaviva,
1581-1615, they first began to have a preponderatingly evil
reputation. In 1581 they were banished from England, and in
1601 the decree of banishment was repeated, this time for their
suspected share in the Gunpowder Plot.</p>

<p><b>3. 3. 206, 7 Come, gi’ me Ten pieces more.</b> The
transaction with Guilthead is perhaps somewhat confusing.
Fitzdottrel has offered to give his bond for two hundred pieces,
if necessary. Merecraft’s ‘old debt of forty’ (3. 3. 149), the
fifty pieces for the ring, and the hundred for Everill’s new
office (3. 3. 60 and 83) ‘all but make two hundred.’ Fitzdottrel
furnishes a hundred of this in cash, with the understanding that
he receive it again of the gold-smith when he signs the bond (3.
3. 194). He returns, however, without the gold, though he seals
the bond (3. 5. 1-3). Of the hundred pieces received in cash,
twenty go to Guilthead as commission (3. 3. 155). This leaves
forty each for Merecraft and Everill.</p>

<p><b>3. 3. 217 And coozen i’ your bullions.</b> Massinger’s <i>Fatal
Dowry</i>, <i>Wks.</i>, p. 272, contains the following passage:
‘The other is his dressing-block, upon whom my lord lays all his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
clothes and fashions ere he vouchsafes them his own person:
you shall see him ... at noon in the Bullion,’ etc. In a note
on this passage (<i>Wks.</i> 3. 390, ed. 1813) Gifford advanced the
theory that the <i>bullion</i> was ‘a piece of finery, which derived
its denomination from the large globular gilt buttons, still in
use on the continent.’ In his note on the present passage, he
adds that it was probably ‘adopted by gamblers and others, as a
mark of wealth, to entrap the unwary.’</p>

<p>Nares was the next man to take up the word. He connected it with
‘<i>bullion</i>; Copper-plates set on the Breast-leathers and Bridles
of Horses for ornament’ (Phillips 1706). ‘I suspect that it also
meant, in colloquial use, copper lace, tassels, and ornaments in
imitation of gold. Hence contemptuously attributed to those who
affected a finery above their station.’</p>

<p>Dyce (B. &amp; Fl., <i>Wks.</i> 7. 291) was the first to disconnect the
word from <i>bullion</i> meaning uncoined gold or silver. He says:
‘<i>Bullions</i>, I apprehend, mean some sort of hose or breeches,
which were <i>bolled</i> or <i>bulled</i>, i. e. swelled, puffed out
(cf. <i>Sad. Shep.</i>, Act 1. Sc. 2, <i>bulled</i> nosegays’).’</p>

<p>The <i>NED.</i> gives ‘prob. a. F. <i>bouillon</i> in senses derived from
that of “bubble.”’</p>

<p>Besides the passages already given, the word occurs in B. &amp; Fl.,
<i>The Chances</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 7. 291:</p>

<p><b>3. 3. 231 too-too-vnsupportable!</b> This reduplicated
form is common in Shakespeare. See <i>Merch. of Ven.</i> 2. 6.
42; <i>Hamlet</i> 1. 2. 129; and Schmidt, <i>Dict.</i> Jonson uses it
in <i>Sejanus</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 3. 54, and elsewhere. It is merely a
strengthened form of <i>too</i>. (See Halliwell in <i>Sh. Soc. Papers</i>,
1884, 1. 39, and <i>Hamlet</i>, ed. Furness, 11th ed., 1. 41.) Jonson
regularly uses the hyphen.</p>

<p><b><a name="Note_3_4_13"></a>3. 4. 13 Cioppinos.</b> Jonson spells the
word as if it were Italian, though he says in the same sentence that the
custom of wearing chopines is Spanish. The <i>NED.</i>, referring to Skeat,
<i>Trans. Phil. Soc.</i>, 1885-7, p. 79, derives it from Sp. <i>chapa</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
a plate of metal, etc. ‘The Eng. writers c 1600 persistently
treated the word as Italian, even spelling it <i>cioppino</i>, pl.
<i>cioppini</i>, and expressly associated it with Venice, so that,
although not recorded in Italian Dicts. it was app. temporarily
fashionable there.’ The statement of the <i>NED.</i> that ‘there is
little or no evidence of their use in England (except on the
stage)’ seems to be contradicted by the quotation from Stephen
Gosson’s <i>Pleasant Quippes</i> (note 1. 1. 128). References to the
chopine are common in the literature of the period (see Nares
and <i>NED.</i>). I have found no instances of the Italianated form
earlier than Jonson, and it may be original with him. He uses
the plural <i>cioppini</i> in <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 241.
See note <a href="#Note_4_4_69">4. 4. 69</a>.</p>

of my wealth.’ Cunningham (<i>Wks.</i> 3. 498) says: ‘Purchase, as readers of
Shakespeare know, was a cant term among thieves for the plunder they acquired,
also the act of acquiring it. It is frequently used by Jonson.’</p>

<p><b>3. 4. 35 Pro’uedor.</b> Gifford’s change to provedoré
is without authority. The word is <i>provedor</i>, Port., or

and the Crosse in <i>Cheap</i>,’ is ‘the most beautifull Frame of faire houses
and shops, that be within the Wals of <i>London</i>, or elsewhere in
England.’ It contained ‘ten faire dwelling houses, and fourteene
shops’ beautified with elaborate ornamentation. Howes (ed. 1631,
p. 1045) says that at his time (1630) Goldsmith’s Row ‘was much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
abated of her wonted store of Goldsmiths, which was the beauty
of that famous streete.’ A similar complaint is made in the
<i>Calendar of State Papers</i>, 1619-23, p. 457, where Goldsmith’s
Row is characterized as the ‘glory and beauty of Cheapside.’
Paul Hentzner (p. 45) speaks of it as surpassing all the other
London streets. He mentions the presence there of a ‘gilt tower,
with a fountain that plays.’</p>

in Shakespeare, <i>Com. Err.</i> 4. 3. 51. The expression is common

which failed of success, and which, with his usual arrogance,

taste in the audience.’&mdash;Massinger’s (<i>Wks.</i>, ed. 1805, 4. 121.)</p>

<p>The <i>Guardian</i> appeared in 1633, two years after the printing of

the present passage.</p>

<p><b>3. 5. 47 pay for his dinner himselfe.</b> The custom of

<p><b><a name="Note_4_2_26"></a>4. 2. 26 Tooth-picks.</b> This was an object
of satire to the dramatists of the period. Nares says that they ‘appear to have
been first brought into use in Italy; whence the travellers who had
visited that country, particularly wished to exhibit that symbol
of gentility.’ It is referred to as the mark of a traveller by
Shakespeare, <i>King John</i>, 1. 1 (cited by Gifford):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">&mdash;Now your traveller,</span>
<span class="i5">He, and his tooth-pick, at my worship’s mess.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Overbury (<i>Character</i> of <i>An Affected Traveller</i>, ed. Morley,
p. 35) speaks of the <i>pick-tooth</i> as ‘a main part of his behavior.’</p>

<p>It was also a sign of foppery. Overbury (p. 31) describes the
courtier as wearing ‘a pick-tooth in his hat,’ and Massinger,
<i>Grand Duke of Florence</i>, Act 3 (quoted by Nares), mentions ‘my
case of tooth-picks, and my silver fork’ among the articles
‘requisite to the making up of a signior.’ John Earle makes
a similar reference in his <i>Character</i> of <i>An Idle Gallant</i>
(ed. Morley, p. 179), and Furnivall (Stubbes’ <i>Anatomy</i>,
p. 77) quotes from <i>Laugh and lie downe</i>: or <i>The worldes
Folly</i>, London, 1605, 4to: ‘The next was a nimble-witted and
glib-tongu’d fellow, who, having in his youth spent his wits
in the Arte of love, was now become the jest of wit.... The
picktooth in the mouth, the flower in the eare, the brush upon
the beard; ... and what not that was unneedefull,’ etc.</p>

<p>It is a frequent subject of satire in Jonson. Cf. <i>Ev. Man out</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 2. 124; <i>Cyn. Rev.</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 218, 248; <i>Fox</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 3. 266. See also Dekker, <i>Wks.</i> 3. 280.</p>

<p><b>4. 2. 63 What vile Fucus is this.</b> The abuse of face-painting is
a favorite subject of satire with the moralists and dramatists of the

period. Stubbes (<i>Anatomy of Abuses</i>, Part 1, pp. 64-8) devotes
a long section to the subject. Dr. Furnivall in the notes
to this passage, pp. 271-3, should also be consulted. Brome
satirizes it in the <i>City Wit</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 300. Lady Politick
Would-be in the <i>Fox</i> is of course addicted to the habit,
and a good deal is said on the subject in <i>Epicoene</i>. Dekker
(<i>West-ward Hoe</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 285) has a passage quite similar in
spirit to Jonson’s satire.</p>

<p><b>4. 2. 71 the very Infanta of the Giants!</b> Cf. Massinger
and Field, <i>Fatal Dowry</i> 4. 1: ‘O that I were the infanta queen
of Europe!’ Pecunia in the <i>Staple of News</i> is called the
‘Infanta of the mines.’ Spanish terms were fashionable at this
time. Cf. the use of <i>Grandees</i>, 1. 3. It is possible that the
reference here is to the Infanta Maria. See Introduction, <a href="#Page_xviii">p. xviii</a>.</p>

<p><b>4. 3. 5, 6 It is the manner of Spaine, to imbrace onely,
Neuer to kisse.</b> Cf. Minsheu’s <i>Pleasant and Delightfull
Dialogues,</i> pp. 51-2: ‘<i>W.</i> I hold that the greatest cause of
dissolutenesse in some women in England is this custome of
kissing publikely.... <i>G.</i> In Spaine doe not men vse to kisse
women? <i>I.</i> Yes the husbands kisse their wiues, but as if it
were behinde seuen walls, where the very light cannot see them.’</p>

<p><b>4. 3. 33 f. Decayes the fore-teeth, that should guard the
tongue;</b> etc. Cf. <i>Timber</i>, ed. Schelling, 13. 24: ‘It was
excellently said of that philosopher, that there was a wall or
parapet of teeth set in our mouth, to restrain the petulancy
of our words; that the rashness of talking should not only be
retarded by the guard and watch of our heart, but be fenced in
and defended by certain strengths placed in the mouth itself,
and within the lips.’</p>

<p>Professor Schelling quotes Plutarch, <i>Moralia, de Garrulitate</i>
3, translated by Goodwin: ‘And yet there is no member of human
bodies that nature has so strongly enclosed within a double
fortification as the tongue, entrenched within a barricade of
sharp teeth, to the end that, if it refuses to obey and keep
silent when reason “presses the glittering reins” within, we
should fix our teeth in it till the blood comes rather than
suffer inordinate and unseasonable din’ (4. 223).</p>

<p><b>4. 3. 39 Mad-dames.</b> See variants. The editors have
taken out of the jest whatever salt it possessed, and have
supplied meaningless substitutes. Gifford followed the same
course in his edition of Ford (see Ford’s <i>Wks.</i> 2. 81), where,
however, he changes to Mad-dam. Such gratuitous corruptions are
inexplicable. Cf. <i>Tale Tub</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 6. 172:</p>

<p><b>4. 3. 51.</b> See variants. There are several mistakes
in the assignment of speeches throughout this act. Not all
of Gifford’s changes, however, are to be accepted without
question. Evidently, if the question <i>where?</i> is to be assigned
to Wittipol, the first speech must be an aside, as it is
inconceivable that Merecraft should introduce Fitzdottrel first
under his own name, and then as the ‘Duke of Drown’d-land.’</p>

<p>My conception of the situation is this: Pug is playing the part
of gentleman usher. He enters and announces to Merecraft that
Fitzdottrel and his wife are coming. Merecraft whispers: ‘Master
Fitzdottrel and his wife! where?’ and then, as they enter, turns
to Wittipol and introduces them; ‘Madame,’ etc.</p>

<p><b>4. 4. 30 Your Allum Scagliola</b>, etc. Many of the words
in this paragraph are obscure, and a few seem irrecoverable.
Doubtless Jonson picked them up from various medical treatises
and advertisements of his day. I find no trace of <i>Abezzo</i>,
which may of course be a misprint for Arezzo. The meanings
assigned to <i>Pol-dipedra</i> and <i>Porcelletto Merino</i> are
unsatisfactory. Florio gives ‘<i>Zucca</i>: a gourd; a casting
bottle,’ but I have been unable to discover <i>Mugia</i>. The
loss of these words is, to be sure, of no moment. Two things
illustrative of Jonson’s method are sufficiently clear. (1)
The articles mentioned are not, as they seem at first, merely
names coined for the occasion. (2) They are a polyglot jumble,
intended to make proficiency in the science of cosmetics as
ridiculous as possible. It is worth while to notice, however,
that this list of drugs is carefully differentiated from the
list at 4. 4. 142 f., which contains the names of sweetmeats
and perfumes.</p>

<p><b><a name="Note_4_4_32"></a>4. 4. 32, 3 Soda di leuante, Or your Ferne
ashes.</b> Soda-ash is still the common trade name of sodium carbonate. In
former times soda was chiefly obtained from natural deposits
and from the incineration of various plants growing by the
sea-shore. These sources have become of little importance
since the invention of artificial soda by Leblanc toward the
end of the eighteenth century (see <i>Soda</i> in <i>CD.</i>). Florio’s
definition of soda is: ‘a kind of Ferne-ashes whereof they make
glasses.’ Cf. also W. Warde, Tr. <i>Alessio’s Secr.</i>, Pt. 1 fol.
78[<sup>m</sup>] 1º: ‘Take an vnce of Soda (which is asshes made of
grasse, whereof glassemakers do vse to make their Cristall).’ In
Chaucer’s <i>Squire’s Tale</i> (11. 254 f.) the manufacture of glass
out of ‘fern-asshen’ is mentioned as a wonder comparable to that
of Canacee’s ring.</p>

<p><b>4. 4. 33 Beniamin di gotta.</b> The <i>Dict. d’Histoire

<p><b>4. 4. 38 With a piece of scarlet.</b>
Lady Politick Would-be’s remedies in the <i>Fox</i> are

to be ‘applied with a right scarlet cloth.’ Scarlet was supposed
to be of great efficacy in disease. See Whalley’s note on the

<p><b>4. 4. 38, 9 makes a Lady of sixty Looke at sixteen.</b>

in perfumes and cosmetics. In <i>Staple of News</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 5.
166, we read: ‘Right Spanish perfume, the lady Estifania’s.’
Estefania is the name of a Spanish lady in B. &amp; Fl.’s

<p><b>4. 4. 47 galley-pot.</b> Mistresse Gallipot is the name of a
tobacconist in Dekker’s and Middleton’s <i>Roaring Girle</i>.</p>

<p><b>4. 4. 50 In decimo sexto.</b> This is a bookbinder’s or
printer’s term, ‘applied to books, etc., a leaf of which is
one-sixteenth of a full sheet or signature.’ It is equivalent
to ‘16mo.’ and hence metaphorically used to indicate ‘a small
compass, miniature’ (see <i>Stanford</i>, p. 312). In <i>Cyn. Rev.</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 2. 218, Jonson says: ‘my braggart in decimo sexto!’
Its use is well exemplified in John Taylor’s <i>Works</i>, sig. L<sub>1</sub>
v<sup>0/1</sup>: ‘when a mans stomache is in Folio, and knows
not where to haue a dinner in Decimo sexto.’ The phrase is
fairly common in the dramatic literature. See Massinger, <i>Unnat.
Combat</i> 3. 2; Middleton, <i>Father Hubburd’s Tales</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 8 64, etc. In the present passage, however, the meaning
evidently required is ‘perfect: ’spotless,’ and no doubt refers to
the comparative perfection of a sexto decimo, or perhaps to the
perfection naturally to be expected of any work in miniature.</p>

<p><b>4. 4. 52 Virgins milke for the face.</b> Cf. John French,
<i>Art Distill.</i>. Bk. 5. p. 135 (1651): ‘This salt being set in
a cold cellar on a marble stone, and dissolved into an oil, is
as good as any <i>Lac virginis</i> to clear, and smooth the face.’
<i>Lac Virginis</i> is spoken of twice in the <i>Alchemist</i>, Act 2,
but probably in neither case is the cosmetic referred to. See
Hathaway’s edition, p. 293. Nash speaks of the cosmetic in
<i>Pierce Pennilesse</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 44: ‘She should haue noynted
your face ouer night with <i>Lac virginis</i>.’</p>

<p><b>4. 4. 63 Doe not you dwindle.</b> The use of <i>dwindle</i>
in this sense is very rare. <i>NED.</i> thinks it is ‘probably a
misuse owing to two senses of <i>shrink</i>.’ It gives only a single
example, <i>Alch.</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 163: ‘Did you not hear the coil
about the door? <i>Sub.</i> Yes, and I dwindled with it.’ Besides the
two instances in Jonson I have noticed only one other, in Ford,
<i>Fancies chaste and noble</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 291: ‘<i>Spa.</i> Hum,
how’s that? is he there, with a wanion! then do I begin to dwindle.’

<p><b><a name="Note_4_4_69"></a>4. 4. 69 Cioppino’s.</b> The source of
this passage, with the anecdote which follows, seems to be taken from Coryat’s
<i>Crudities</i> (ed. 1776, 2. 36, 7): ‘There is one thing vsed of
the Venetian women, and some others dwelling in the cities and
towns subject to the Signiory of Venice, that is not to be
obserued (I thinke) amongst any other women in Christendome:
which is so common in Venice, that no woman whatsoeuer goeth
without it, either in her house or abroad; a thing made of wood,
and couered with leather of sundry colors, some with white, some
redde, some yellow. It is called a Chapiney, which they weare
vnder their shoes. Many of them are curiously painted; some also
I haue seene fairely gilt: so vncomely a thing (in my opinion)
that it is pitty this foolish custom is not cleane banished and
exterminated out of the citie. There are many of these Chapineys
of a great heigth, euen half a yard high, which maketh many of
their women that are very short, seeme much taller then the
tallest women we haue in England. Also I haue heard that this is
obserued amongst them, that by how much the nobler a woman is,
by so much the higher are her Chapineys. All their Gentlewomen,
and most of their wiues and widowes that are of any wealth, are
assisted and supported eyther by men or women when they walke
abroad, to the end they may not fall. They are borne vp most
commonly by the left arme, otherwise they might quickly take a
fall. For I saw a woman fall a very dangerous fall as she was
going down the staires of one of the little stony bridges with
her high Chapineys alone by her selfe: but I did nothing pitty
her, because shee wore such friuolous and (as I may truely term
them) ridiculous instruments, which were the occasion of her
fall. For both I myselfe, and many other strangers (as I haue
obserued in Venice) haue often laughed at them for their vaine Chapineys.’</p>

<p><b><a name="Note_4_4_71"></a>4. 4. 71, 2 Spanish pumps Of perfum’d leather.</b>
Pumps are first mentioned in the sixteenth century (Planché). A reference
to them occurs in <i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, 1593-4, 4. 2. They
were worn especially by footmen.</p>

<p>Spanish leather was highly esteemed at this time. Stubbes
(<i>Anat. of Abuses</i>, Part 1, p. 77) says: ‘They haue korked
shooes, pinsnets, pantoffles, and slippers, ... some of
spanish leather, and some of English lether.’ Marston (<i>Dutch
Courtezan</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 7) speaks of a ‘Spanish leather jerkin,’
and Middleton (<i>Father Hubburd’s Tales</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 8. 70) of ‘a
curious pair of boots of King Philip’s leather,’ and a little
farther on (<i>Wks.</i> 8. 108) of Spanish leather shoes. Fastidious
Brisk’s boots are made of the same material (<i>Ev. Man out</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 2. 147). Cf. also Dekker, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 305.</p>

<p>Perfumes were much in fashion, and Stubbes’ <i>Anatomy</i> has a
great deal to say on the subject. We hear of perfumed jerkins in
Marston’s <i>Malcontent</i> (<i>Wks.</i> 1. 314) and in <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
(<i>Wks.</i> 2. 325). Spanish perfume for gloves is spoken of in the
latter play (p. 328) and in the <i>Alchemist</i> (<i>Wks.</i> 4. 131)
‘your Spanish titillation in a glove’ is declared to be the best
perfume.</p>

<p><b>4. 4. 81 flat spred, as an Vmbrella.</b> The umbrella of
the seventeenth century seems to have been used exclusively to
protect the face from the sun. Blount, <i>Glossographia</i>, 1670,
gives: ‘<i>Umbrello</i> (Ital. Ombrella), a fashion of round and
broad Fans, wherewith the Indians (and from them our great ones)
preserve themselves from the heat of the sun or fire; and hence
any little shadow, Fan, or other thing wherewith women guard
their faces from the sun.’</p>

<p>It was apparently not in use in England when Coryat published
his <i>Crudities</i>, which contains the following description (1.
135): ‘Also many of them doe carry other fine things of a far
greater price, that will cost at the least a duckat, which
they commonly call in the Italian tongue <i>vmbrellaes</i>, that
is, things that minister shadow unto them for shelter against
the scorching heate of the sunne. These are made of leather
something answerable to the forme of a little cannopy, &amp; hooped
in the inside with diuers little wooden hoopes that extend the
<i>vmbrella</i> in a pretty large compasse.’</p>

<p>‘As a defense from rain or snow it was not used in western
Europe till early in the eighteenth century.’&mdash;<i>CD.</i></p>

<p><b>4. 4. 82 Her hoope.</b> A form of the farthingale (fr.
Sp. <i>Verdugal</i>) was worn in France, Spain, and Italy, and
in England as early as 1545. It gradually increased in size,
and Elizabeth’s farthingale was enormous. The aptness of the
comparison can be appreciated by reading Coryat’s description of
the umbrella above.</p>

‘Gentleman-Usher. Originally a state-officer, attendant upon queens, and
other persons of high rank, as, in Henry VIII, Griffith is
gentleman-usher to Queen Catherine; afterwards a private
affectation of state, assumed by persons of distinction, or
those who pretended to be so, and particularly ladies. He
was then only a sort of upper servant, out of livery, whose
office was to hand his lady to her coach, and to walk before
her bare-headed, though in later times she leaned upon his arm.’&mdash;Nares.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Cf. Dekker, <i>West-ward Hoe</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 324: ‘Weare furnisht for

<p>The sources for a study of the gentleman-usher are the present
play, <i>The Tale of a Tub</i>, and Chapman’s <i>Gentleman Usher</i>.
In the <i>Staple of News</i> the Lady Pecunia is provided with a
gentleman-usher. The principal duties of this office seem to
have consisted in being sent on errands, handing the lady to
her coach, and preceding her on any occasion where ceremony was
demanded. In Chapman’s play Lasso says that the disposition of
his house for the reception of guests was placed in the hands
of this servant (cf. Chapman, <i>Wks.</i> 1. 263 f.). Innumerable
allusions occur in which the requirement of going bare-headed
is mentioned (see note on <a href="#Note_4_4_202">4. 4. 202</a>). Another necessary
quality was a fine pace, which is alluded to in the present character’s
name (see also note <a href="#Note_4_4_201">4. 4. 201</a>). An excellent description
of the gentleman-usher will be found in Nares’ <i>Glossary,</i> quoting from
Lenton’s <i>Leasures</i>, a book published in 1631, and now very rare.</p>

en las meneos, que basta para pegar fuego aun á las personas muy
honestas’ (‘amongst other inventions there has appeared during
late years a dance and song, so lascivious in its words, so ugly
in its movements, that it is enough to inflame even very modest
people’). ‘This reputation was not confined to Spain, for Marini
in his poem “L’Adone” (1623) says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Chiama questo suo gioco empio e profano</span>
<span class="i5">Saravanda, e Ciaccona, il nuova Ispano.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Padre Mariana, who believed in its Spanish origin, says that
its invention was one of the disgraces of the nation, and other
authors attribute its invention directly to the devil. The dance
was attacked by Cervantes and Guevara, and defended by Lope de
Vega, but it seems to have been so bad that at the end of the
reign of Philip II. it was for a time suppressed. It was soon,
however, revived in a purer form and was introduced at the
French court in 1588’ (Grove 3. 226-7).</p>

<p>In England the saraband was soon transformed into an ordinary
country-dance. Two examples are to be found in the first edition
of Playford’s <i>Dancing Master</i>, and Sir John Hawkins (<i>Hist.
of the Science and Practice of Music</i>, 1776) speaks of it
several times. ‘Within the memory of persons now living,’ he
says, a Saraband danced by a Moor was constantly a part of the
entertainment at a puppet-show’ (4. 388). In another place
(2. 135), in speaking of the use of castanets at a puppet-show, he
says: ‘That particular dance called the Saraband is supposed to
require as a thing of necessity, the music, if it may be called
so, of this artless instrument.’</p>

<p>In the <i>Staple of News</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 5. 256, Jonson speaks of
‘a light air! the bawdy Saraband!’</p>

<p><b>4. 4. 165 Heare, and talke bawdy; laugh as loud, as a
larum.</b> Jonson satirizes these vices again in <i>U. 67</i>
(see note <a href="#Note_4_4_156">4. 4. 156</a>) and <i>Epigrams</i> 48 and <i>115</i>.
Dekker (<i>Guls Horne-booke</i>, <i>Non-dram. Wks.</i> 2. 238) advises the
young gallant to ‘discourse as lowd as you can, no matter to what
purpose, ... and laugh in fashion, ... you shall be much obserued.’</p>

<p><b>4. 4. 172 Shee must not lose a looke on stuffes, or

tissues,’ plain woolen cloth was despised.</p>

<p><b>4. 4. 187 Blesse vs from him!</b> Preserve us. A precaution against
any evil that might result from pronouncing the devil’s name.

head of the gentleman-usher. ‘It was a piece of state, that the
servants of the nobility, particularly the gentleman-usher,
should attend bare-headed.’ Nares, <i>Gloss.</i> For numerous
passages illustrating the practice both in regard to the
gentleman-usher and to the coachman, see the quotations in
Nares, and Ford, <i>Lover’s Melancholy</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 1. 19; Chapman,
<i>Gentleman-Usher</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 1. 263; and the following passage,
<i>ibid.</i> 1. 273:</p>

<p>A passage from Lenton (see note <a href="#Note_4_4_134">4. 4. 134</a>) may
also be quoted: ‘He is forced to stand bare, which would urge him to impatience,
but for the hope of being covered, or rather the delight hee
takes in shewing his new-crisp’t hayre, which his barber hath
caused to stand like a print hedge, in equal proportion.’</p>

<p>The dramatists ridiculed it by insisting that the coachman
should be not only bare-headed, but bald. Cf. 2. 3. 36 and
Massinger, <i>City Madam</i>, <i>Wks.</i> p. 331: ‘Thou shalt have thy
proper and bald-headed coachman.’ Jonson often refers to this
custom. Cf. <i>Staple of News</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 5. 232:</p>

speaks of ‘a country gentleman that brings his wife vp to learne
the fashion, see the Tombs at Westminster, the Lyons in the
Tower, or to take physicke.’ In the 1812 reprint the editor
observes that in Jonson’s time ‘fanciful or artful wives

that the word is the same as <i>shue</i>, ‘to frighten away poultry,’
and Cunningham accepts this without question. There seems, however,
to be no confirmation for the theory that the preterit was ever
spelt <i>sou’t</i>. Wright’s <i>Dialect Dictionary</i> gives: ‘<i>Sough.</i>
19. to strike; to beat severely,’ but the pronunciation here
seems usually to be <i>souff</i>. Professor Wright assures me that

who should excel at this exercise, (archery) when Barlo, one of
his guards, an inhabitant of Shoreditch, acquired such honor
as an archer, that the king created him <i>duke of Shoreditch</i>,
on the spot. This title, together with that of marquis of
Islington, earl of Pancridge, etc., was taken from these
villages, in the neighborhood of Finsbury fields, and continued
so late as 1683. Ellis’s <i>History of Shoreditch</i>, p. 170.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The latest account is this: In 1682 there was a most magnificent

the title of <i>duke of Shoreditch</i>, etc., upon the most
deserving. The king was present. <i>Ibid.</i> 173.’&mdash;Nares, <i>Gloss</i>.</p>

<p>Entick (<i>Survey</i> 2. 65) gives an interesting account of a
match which took place in 1583. The Duke of Shoreditch was
accompanied on this occasion by the ‘marquises of <i>Barlow</i>,
<i>Clerkenwell</i>, <i>Islington</i>, <i>Hoxton</i>, and <i>Shaklewell</i>,
the earl of <i>Pancras</i>, etc. These, to the number of 3000, assembled
at the place appointed, sumptuously apparelled, and 942 of
them had gold chains about their necks. They marched from
merchant-taylors-hall, preceded by whifflers and bellmen, that
made up the number 4000, besides pages and footmen; performing
several exercises and evolutions in <i>Moorfields</i>, and at last
shot at the target for glory in <i>Smithfield</i>.’</p>

Jackson (<i>N. &amp; Q.</i> 4. 7. 176) mentions it as frequently used
by the mayors of Doncaster in former days. Cf. also Glapthorne

<p>Cf. also Holinshed, <i>Chron.</i> (quoted <i>CD.</i>):‘As they distill
the best aqua-vitæ, so they spin the choicest <i>rug</i> in Ireland.’
Fynes Moryson (<i>Itinerary</i>, fol. 1617, p. 160) says that the
Irish merchants were forbidden to export their wool, in order
that the peasants might ‘be nourished by working it into cloth,
namely, Rugs ... &amp; mantles generally worn by men and women, and
exported in great quantity.’</p>

<p>Jonson mentions rug as an article of apparel several times. In
<i>Alch.</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 14, it is spoken of as the dress of a poor
man and <i>ibid.</i> 4. 83 as that of an astrologer. In <i>Ev. Man out</i>
(<i>Wks.</i> 2. 110) a similar reference is made, and here Gifford
explains that rug was ‘the usual dress of mathematicians,
astrologers, &amp;c., when engaged in their sublime speculations.’
Marston also speaks of rug gowns as the symbol of a strict life
(<i>What You Will</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 395):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><b>5. 2. 1 ff. put me To yoaking foxes,</b> etc. Several at
least of the following employments are derived from proverbial
expressions familiar at the time. Jonson speaks of ‘milking
he-goats’ in <i>Timber,</i> ed. Schelling, p. 34, which the editor
explains as ‘a proverbial expression for a fruitless task.’ The
occupation of lines 5-6 is adapted from a popular proverb given
by Cotgrave: ‘J’aymeroy autant tirer vn pet d’un Asne mort,
que. I would as soone vndertake to get a fart of a dead man, as
&amp;c.’ Under <i>Asne</i> he explains the same proverb as meaning ‘to
worke impossibilities.’ This explains the passage in <i>Staple
of News</i> 3. 1., <i>Wks.</i> 5. 226. The proverb is quoted again
in <i>Eastward Ho</i>, Marston, <i>Wks.</i> 3. 90, and in Wm. Lilly’s
Observations,’ <i>Hist.</i>, pp. 269-70. ‘Making ropes of sand’ was
Iniquity’s occupation in 1. 1. 119. This familiar proverb first
appears in Aristides 2. 309: ἑκ ψάμμου σχοινίον πλέκειν. In the
<i>New Inn</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 5. 394, Lovel says: ‘I will go catch the
wind first in a sieve.’ Whalley says that the occupation of ‘keeping
fleas within a circle’ is taken from Socrates’ employment in
the <i>Clouds</i> of Aristophanes (ll. 144-5). Gifford, however,
ridicules the notion. Jonson refers to the passage in the
<i>Clouds</i> in <i>Timber</i> (ed. Schelling, 82. 33), where he thinks
it would have made the Greeks merry to see Socrates ‘measure
how many foot a flea could skip geometrically.’ But here again
we seem to have a proverbial expression. It occurs in the
morality-play of <i>Nature</i>, 642. II (quoted by Cushman, p. 116):</p>

<p><a name="Note_5_3_6"></a><b>5. 3. 6 little Darrels tricks.</b>
John Darrel (fl. 1562-1602) was born, it is believed, at Mansfield,
Nottinghamshire, about 1562. He graduated at Cambridge, studied
law, and then became a preacher at Mansfield. He began to
figure as an exorcist in 1586, when he pretended to cast out an
evil spirit from Catherine Wright of Ridgway Lane, Derbyshire.
In 1596 he exorcised Thomas Darling, a boy of fourteen, of
Burton-on-Trent, for bewitching whom Alice Goodrich was tried
and convicted at Derby. A history of the case was written by
Jesse Bee of Burton (Harsnet, <i>Discovery</i>, p. 2). The boy
Darling went to Merton College, and in 1603 was sentenced by the
Star-chamber to be whipped, and to lose his ears for libelling
the vice-chancellor of Oxford. In March, 1596-7, Darrel
was sent for to Clayworth Hall, Shakerly, in Leigh parish,
Lancashire, where he exorcised seven persons of the household
of Mr. Nicholas Starkie, who accused one Edmund Hartley of
bewitching them, and succeeded in getting the latter condemned
and executed in 1597. In November, 1597, Darrel was invited to
Nottingham to dispossess William Somers, an apprentice, and
shortly after his arrival was appointed preacher of St. Mary’s
in that town, and his fame drew crowded congregations to listen
to his tales of devils and possession. Darrel’s operations
having been reported to the Archbishop of York, a commission of
inquiry was issued (March 1597-8), and he was prohibited from
preaching. Subsequently the case was investigated by Bancroft,
bishop of London, and S. Harsnet, his chaplain, when Somers,
Catherine Wright, and Mary Cooper confessed that they had been
instructed in their simulations by Darrel. He was brought before
the commissioners and examined at Lambeth on 26 May 1599, was
pronounced an impostor, degraded from the ministry and committed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to the Gatehouse. He remained in prison for at least a year, but
it is not known what became of him. (Abridged from <i>DNB.</i>)</p>

country that I saw in my trauels, neither doe I thinke that any
other nation of Christendome doth vse it, but only Italy. The
Italian and also most strangers that are commorant in Italy,
doe alwaies in their meales vse a little forke when they cut
their meate. For while with their knife which they hold in one
hand they cut the meate out of the dish, they fasten their
forke which they hold in their other hand vpon the same dish,
so that whatsoeuer he be that sitting in the company of any
others at meale, should vnadvisedly touch the dish of meate with
his fingers from which all at the table doe cut, he will giue
occasion of offence vnto the company, as hauing transgressed the

is generally vsed in all places of Italy, their forkes being
for the most part made of yron or steele, and some of siluer,

custom home with him to England, for which a friend dubbed him

to the ‘boy of Bilson,’ but, as Gifford points out, this case
did not occur until 1620, four years after the production of
the present play. Gifford believes Thomas Harrison, the ‘boy
of Norwich,’ to be alluded to. A short account of his case is
given in Hutchinson’s <i>Impostures Detected</i>, pp. 262 f. The
affair took place in 1603 or 1604, and it was thought necessary
to ‘require the Parents of the said Child, that they suffer not
any to repair to their House to visit him, save such as are
in Authority and other Persons of special Regard, and known
Discretion.’ Hutchinson says that Harrison was twelve years
old. It is quite possible, though not probable, that Jonson is
referring again to the Boy of Burton, who was only two years
older. See note <a href="#Note_5_3_6">5. 3. 6</a>.</p>

custom,” says he, “obtains in most of our gaols, which is that
of the prisoners demanding of a newcomer <i>garnish</i>, footing,
or (as it is called in some London gaols) chummage. <i>Pay</i> or

<p>For the present use cf. T. Adams in Spurgeon, <i>Treas. Dav.</i>,

<p><b>5. 6. 21 the Session.</b> The general or quarter sessions
were held regularly four times a year on certain days prescribed

not strictly adhered to. See Beard, <i>The Office of the Justice

3. 128 f.</p>

<p><b>5. 6. 24 The charriot of Triumph, which most of them are.</b>
The procession from Newgate by Holbom and Tyburn road was in
truth often a ‘triumphall egression,’ and a popular criminal
like Jack Sheppard or Jonathan Wild frequently had a large
attendance. Cf. Shirley, <i>Wedding</i> 4. 3, <i>Wks.</i>,
ed. Gifford, 1. 425: ‘Now I’m in the cart, riding up Holborn in
a two-wheeled chariot, with a guard of Halberdiers. <i>There goes
a proper fellow</i>, says one; good people pray for me: now I am at
the three wooden stilts,’ etc.</p>

<p><b>5. 6. 48 a body intire.</b> Jonson uses the word in its
strict etymological sense.</p>

<p><b>5. 6. 54 cheated on.</b> Dyce (<i>Remarks</i>) points out that
this phrase is used in Mrs. Centlivre’s <i>Wonder</i>, Act 2. Sc. 1.
Jonson uses it again in <i>Mercury vindicated</i>: ‘and cheat upon
your under-officers;’ and Marston in <i>What You Will</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 2. 387.</p>

<p><b><a name="Note_5_6_64"></a>5. 6. 64 Prouinciall o’ the Cheaters!</b>
<i>Provincial</i> is a term borrowed from the church. See Gloss. Of the

London</i>, <i>Non-dram. Wks.</i> 3. 116 f.: ‘Of all which <i>Lawes</i>,
the <i>Highest</i> in place, and the <i>Highest</i> in perdition is the

<p><b>5. 6. 64 Bawd-ledger.</b> Jonson speaks of a similar official
in <i>Every Man out</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 2. 132: ‘He’s a leiger at Horn’s
ordinary (cant name for a bawdy-house) yonder.’ See Gloss.</p>

<p><b>5. 6. 68 to sindge your nayles off.</b> In the fool’s song in
<i>Twelfth Night</i> we have the exclamation to the devil: ‘paire thy
nayles dad’ (Furness’s ed., p. 273). The editor quotes Malone:
‘The Devil was supposed from choice to keep his nails unpared,
and therefore to pare them was an affront. So, in Camden’s
<i>Remaines</i>, 1615: “I will follow mine owne minde, and mine old
trade; who shall let me? the divel’s nailes are unparde.”’</p>

<p>Compare also <i>Henry V.</i> 4. 4. 76: ‘Bardolph and Nym had ten
times more valor than this roaring devil i’ the old play, that
every one may pare his nails with a wooden dagger.’</p>

<p><b>5. 6. 76 The Diuell was wont to carry away the euill.</b>
Eckhardt, p. 100, points out that Jonson’s etymology of the word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
<i>Vice</i>, which has been a matter of dispute, was the generally
accepted one, that is, from <i>vice</i> = evil.</p>

<p><b>5. 7. 1 Iustice Hall.</b> ‘The name of the Sessions-house in
the Old Bailey.’&mdash;G. Strype, B. 3. p. 281 says that it was ‘a
fair and stately building, very commodious for that affair.’
‘It standeth backwards, so that it hath no front towards the
street, only the gateway leading into the yard before the House,
which is spacious. It cost above £6000 the building. And in this
place the Lord Mayor, Recorder, the Aldermen and Justices of the
Peace for the County of Middlesex do sit, and keep his Majesty’s
Sessions of Oyer and Terminer.’ It was destroyed in the Gordon
Riots of 1780.&mdash;Wh-C.</p>

<p><b>5. 7. 9 This strange!</b> See variants. The change seriously
injures the metre, and the original reading should be preserved.
Such absorptions (<i>this</i> for <i>this is</i> or <i>this’s</i>)
are not uncommon. Cf. <i>Macbeth</i> 3. 4. 17, ed. Furness, p. 165:
‘yet he’s good’ for ‘yet he is as good.’</p>

<p><b>5. 8. 2 They had giu’n him potions.</b> Jonson perhaps had
in mind the trial of Anne Turner and her accomplices in the
Overbury Case of the previous year. See Introduction, <a href="#Page_lxxii">p. lxxii</a>.
For a discussion of love-philtres see Burton, <i>Anat. of Mel.</i>
(ed. Bullen), 3. 145 f.</p>

<p><b>5. 8. 33 with a Wanion.</b> This word is found only in the
phrases ‘with a wanion,’ ‘in a wanion,’ and ‘wanions on you.’ It
is a kind of petty imprecation, and occurs rather frequently in
the dramatists, but its precise signification and etymology are
still in doubt. Boswell, <i>Malone</i>, 21. 61, proposed a derivation
from <i>winnowing</i>,‘a beating;’ Nares from <i>wanung</i>, Saxon,
‘detriment;’ Dyce (Ford’s <i>Wks.</i> 2. 291) from wan (vaande,
Dutch, ‘a rod or wand’), ‘of which <i>wannie</i> and <i>wannion</i> are
familiar diminutives.’ The <i>CD.</i> makes it a later form of ME.
<i>waniand</i>, ‘a waning,’ spec. of the moon, regarded as implying
ill luck.</p>

<p><b>5. 8. 34 If his hornes be forth, the Diuells companion!</b>
The jest is too obvious not to be a common one. Thus in
<i>Eastward Ho</i> Slitgut, who is impersonating the cuckold at
Horn-fair, says: ‘Slight! I think the devil be abroad. in
likeness of a storm, to rob me of my horns!’,&mdash;Marston’s <i>Wks.</i>
3. 72. Cf. also <i>Staple of News</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 5. 186: ‘And why
would you so fain see the devil? would I say. Because he has horns,
wife, and may be a cuckold as well as a devil.’</p>

witchcraft see Introduction, <a href="#Page_xlix">p. xlix</a>.</p>

<p><b>5. 8. 40 The Cockscomb, and the Couerlet.</b> Wittipol is
evidently selecting an appropriate name for Fitzdottrel’s buffoonery
after the manner of the puppet-shows. It is quite possible that
some actual <i>motion</i> of the day was styled ‘the Coxcomb and the Coverlet.’
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p><b>5. 8. 50 shee puts in a pinne.</b> Pricking with pins and
needles was one of the devil’s regular ways of tormenting
bewitched persons. They were often supposed to vomit these
articles. So when Voltore feigns possession, Volpone cries out:
‘See! He vomits crooked pins’ (<i>The Fox</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 3. 312).</p>

<p><b>5. 8. 61 the Kings Constable.</b> ‘From the earliest times
to our own days, there were two bodies of police in England,
namely, the parish and high constables, and the watchmen in
cities and boroughs. Nothing could exceed their inefficiency
in the 17th century. Of the constables, Dalton (in the reign
of James I.) observes that they “are often absent from their
houses, being for the most part husbandmen.” The charge of
Dogberry shows probably with no great caricature what sort
of watchmen Shakespeare was familiar with. As late as 1796,
Colquhoun observes that the watchmen “were aged and often
superannuated men.” ’&mdash;Sir J. Stephen,
<i>Hist. Crim. Law</i> 1. 194 f.</p>

<p><b>5. 8. 71 The taking of Tabacco, with which the Diuell<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Is so delighted.</b> This was an old joke of the time. In
Middleton’s <i>Black Book</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 8. 42 f. the devil makes
his will, a part of which reads as follows: ‘But turning my legacy
to you-ward, Barnaby Burning-glass, arch-tobacco-taker of
England, in ordinaries, upon stages both common and private,
and lastly, in the lodging of your drab and mistress; I am not
a little proud, I can tell you, Barnaby, that you dance after
my pipe so long, and for all counter-blasts and tobacco-Nashes
(which some call railers), you are not blown away, nor your
fiery thirst quenched with the small penny-ale of their
contradictions, but still suck that dug of damnation with a long
nipple, still burning that rare Phoenix of Phlegethon, tobacco,
that from her ashes, burned and knocked out, may arise another pipeful.’</p>

<p>Middleton here refers to Nash’s <i>Pierce Pennilesse</i> and King
James I.’s <i>Counterblast to Tobacco</i>. The former in his
supplication to the devil says: ‘It is suspected you have been
a great <i>tobacco</i>-taker in your youth.’ King James describes it
as ‘a custom loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful
to the brain, dangerous to the lungs, and in the black stinking
fume thereof, nearest resembling the horrid stygian smoke of the
pit that is bottomless.’</p>

<p>The dramatists seem never to grow tired of this joking allusion
to the devil and his pipe of tobacco. Cf. Dekker, <i>If this be
not a good Play</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 3. 293: ‘I think the Diuell is
sucking Tabaccho, heeres such a Mist.’ <i>Ibid.</i> 327: ‘Are there
gentleman diuels too? this is one of those, who studies the black Art,
thats to say, drinkes Tobacco.’ Massinger, <i>Guardian</i>, <i>Wks.</i>, p. 344:

<p>Dekker (<i>Non-dram. Wks.</i> 2. 89) speaks of ‘that great
<i>Tobacconist</i> the Prince of Smoake &amp; darknes, <i>Don Pluto</i>.’</p>

<p>The art of <i>taking</i> or <i>drinking</i> tobacco was much cultivated
and had its regular professors. The <i>whiff</i>, the <i>ring</i>, etc.,
are often spoken of. For the general subject see Dekker, <i>Guls
Horne-booke</i>; Barnaby Riche, <i>Honestie of this Age</i>, 1613;
Harrison, <i>Chronology</i>, 1573; <i>Every Man in</i>, etc. An excellent
description of a tobacconist’s shop is given in <i>Alchemist</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 4. 37. For a historical account of its introduction see
Wheatley. <i>Ev. Man in</i>, p. xlvii.</p>

<p>Jonson’s form <i>tabacco</i> is the same as the Italian and
Portuguese. See Alden, <i>Bart. Fair</i>, p. 169.</p>

<p><b>5. 8. 74, 5 yellow, etc.<br />

general subject of yellow starch see note <a href="#Note_1_1_112">1. 1. 112, 3</a>.
Compare also Stubbes, <i>Anat. of Abuses</i>, p. 52: ‘The deuil, as he in
the fulness of his malice, first inuented these great ruffes,
so hath hee now found out also two great stayes to beare vp and
maintaine this his kingdome of great ruffes.... The one arch or
piller whereby his kingdome of great ruffes is vnderpropped, is
a certaine kinde of liquide matter which they call <i>starch</i>,
wherein the devil hath willed them to wash and diue his ruffes wel.’</p>

<p>‘Starch hound’ and ‘Tobacco spawling (spitting)’ are the names
of two devils in Dekker’s <i>If this be not a good Play</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 3. 270. Jonson speaks of ‘that idol starch’ again
in the <i>Alchemist</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 4. 92.</p>

<p><b>5. 8. 78 He is the Master of Players.</b> An evident allusion
to the Puritan attacks on the stage. This was the period of the
renewed literary contest. George Wither had lately published
his <i>Abuses stript and whipt</i>, 1613. For the whole subject see
Thompson, E. N. S., <i>The Controversy between the Puritans and

<p><b>5. 8. 89 To come to dinner, in mee the sinner.</b> The
conception of this couplet and the lines which Fitzdottrel
speaks below was later elaborated in Cocklorrel’s song in the
<i>Gipsies Metamorphosed</i>. Pluto in Dekker’s <i>If this be not a
good Play</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 3. 268, says that every devil should have
‘a brace of whores to his breakfast.’ Such ideas seem to be
descended from the mediæval allegories of men like Raoul de
Houdanc, Ruteboeuf, etc.</p>

Bailey (occasionally written St. ’Pulcher’s) is a church at the
western end of Newgate Street and in the ward of Farringdon
Without. A church existed here in the twelfth century. The
church which Jonson knew was built in the middle of the
fifteenth century. The body of the church was destroyed in the
Great Fire of 1666.</p>

<p>It was the custom formerly for the clerk or bellman of St.
Sepulchre’s to go under Newgate on the night preceding the
execution of a criminal, and, ringing his bell, to repeat
certain verses, calling the prisoner to repentance. Another
curious custom observed at this church was that of presenting a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
nosegay to every criminal on his way to Tyburn (see Wh-C.). The
executed criminals were buried in the churchyard (d. Middleton,
<i>Black Book</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 8. 25).</p>

<p>Cunningham says that ‘the word <i>steeple</i> was not used in the
restricted sense to which we now confine it. The <i>tower</i> of
St. Sepulchre’s in Jonson’s time, must have been very much like
what we now see it as most carefully and tastefully restored.’</p>

<p><b>5. 8. 134 as farre as Ware.</b> This is a distance of about
22 miles. Ware is an ancient market-town of Herts, situated in
a valley on the north side of the river Lea. The ‘great bed of
Ware’ is mentioned in <i>Twelfth Night</i> 3. 2. 51, and the town
is characterized as ‘durty Ware’ in Dekker’s <i>North-ward Hoe</i>,
<i>Wks.</i> 3. 53.</p>

<p><b>5. 8. 142, 3 I will tell truth</b>, etc. Jonson uses this proverb again
in <i>Tale Tub</i>, <i>Wks.</i> 6. 150: ‘tell troth and shame the devil.’

<h2>GLOSSARY</h2>

<p>This glossary is designed to include obsolete, archaic,
dialectal, and rare words; current words used in obsolete, archaic,
or exceptional senses; and, so far as practicable, obsolete and
archaic phrases. Current words in current uses have occasionally been
included to avoid confusion, as well as technical words unfamiliar to
the ordinary reader. Favorite words have been treated, for the sake
of illustration, with especial fullness.</p>

<p>For most words treated in its volumes published up to March,
1905, Murray’s <i>New English Dictionary</i> is the chief authority.
For words not reached by that work the <i>Century Dictionary</i>
has been preferred. The <i>Stanford Dictionary</i> has been found
especially useful for anglicized words. It has often been
necessary to resort to contemporary foreign dictionaries in the
case of words of Romance origin.</p>

<p>It has been thought best to refer to all or nearly all important
passages. Etymologies are given only in cases of especial interest.</p>

<p>A dagger [†] before a word or definition indicates that the word
or the particular meaning is obsolete; parallel lines [||] before
a word, that it has never become naturalized in English; an
interrogation point [?], that the case is doubtful.</p>

In general the devil is more closely related to the clown, and
the Vice to the fool. In some cases, however, the devil is to be

In the Digby group of miracle-plays roaring by the devil is
a prominent feature. Stage directions in <i>Paul</i> provide for
‘cryeing and rorying’ and Belial enters with the cry, ‘Ho, ho,
behold me.’ Among the moralities <i>The Disobedient Child</i> may be
mentioned.</p></div>

Cushman points out that it occurs in only one drama, that of <i>Like
will to Like</i>. He attributes the currency of the notion that this
mode of exit was the regular one to the famous passage in Harsnet’s
<i>Declaration of Popish Impostures</i> (p. 114, 1603): ‘It was a pretty
part in the old church-playes, when the nimble Vice would skip
up nimbly like a jackanapes into the devil’s necke, and ride the
devil a course, and belabour him with his wooden dagger, till he
made him roare, whereat the people would laugh to see the devil so
vice-haunted.’ The moralities and tragedies give no indication of
hostility between Vice and devil. Cushman believes therefore that
Harsnet refers either to some lost morality or to ‘Punch and Judy.’
It is significant, however, that in ‘Punch and Judy,’ which gives
indications of being a debased descendant of the morality, the
devil enters with the evident intention of carrying the hero off to
hell. The joke consists as in the present play in a reversal of the
usual proceeding. Eckhardt (p. 85 n.) points out that the Vice’s
cudgeling of the devil was probably a mere mirth-provoking device,
and indicated no enmity between the two. Moreover the motive of the
devil as an animal for riding is not infrequent. In the <i>Castle
of Perseverance</i> the devil carries away the hero, Humanum Genus.
The motive appears also in Greene’s <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i>
and Lodge and Greene’s <i>Looking Glass for London and England</i>,
and especially in <i>Histriomastix</i>, where the Vice rides a roaring
devil (Eckhardt, pp. 86 f.). We have also another bit of evidence
from Jonson himself. In <i>The Staple of News</i> Mirth relates her
reminiscences of the old comedy. In speaking of the devil she says:
‘He would carry away the Vice on his back quick to hell in every play.’</p></div>

(ch. 20, p. 134), is as follows: ‘And if that the bowle of curds
and cream were not duly set out for Robin Goodfellow, the Friar,
and Sisse the dairy-maide, why then either the pottage was burnt
the next day, or the cheese would not curdle,’ etc. Cf. also Scot,

cousening idle frier, or some such roge, that wanted nothing either
belonging to lecherie or knaverie, &amp;c.’</p></div>

Darrel’s answer, <i>A Detection of that sinnful, shamful, lying and
ridiculous Discours, of Samuel Harshnet, entituled: A Discoverie,
etc.... Imprinted 1600</i>, which apparently cites all of Harsnet’s more
important points for refutation. It has been lent me through the
kindness of Professor George L. Burr from the Cornell Library. The
quotations from Harsnet in the following pages are accordingly taken

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
